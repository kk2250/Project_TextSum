Also, newly energized black majorities are pressuring it to give producers better terms. South Africa\\'s major sources of wealth may be nationalized and Namibia may demand a one-fifth stake in De Beers\\' local subsidiary. To limit risk, De Beers is moving half its interests to Switzerland. De Beers was formed in 1888 by British colonialist Cecil Rhodes. Diamond merchant Ernest Oppenheimer became board chairman in 1929 and formed the cartel, led after him by his son Harry who made the company more international and less vulnerable.\\nIntroduction:\\n   A stone\\'s throw from the smelly Smithfield meat\\nmarket is an office building complex with no sign or anything to\\nattract the attention of Londoners hurrying by.\\n   Mounted cameras, jumpy guards and heavy doors keep out the\\nuninvited. The gold-colored interior is hushed and luxuriously\\ndecorated.\\n   This is the Central Selling Organization, London-based marketing\\narm of the De Beers diamond empire, controlled by the wealthy\\nOppenheimer family of South Africa. Its experts sort mounds of\\nrough diamonds constituting 80 percent of the world\\'s annual\\nproduction.\\n   But scratch the surface of this secretive world, and the diamond\\nbusiness loses some sparkle.\\n   Sales have declined sharply, and the 56-year-old cartel is\\nfacing pressure to give producers better terms and allow them to\\nsell more of their own gems.\\n   Although its prosperity and control of the world diamond\\nindustry looks unchallengeable, the pressures could loosen its grip\\nand crimp its profits.\\n   ``This year is going to be a critical one for De Beers,\\'\\' says\\nDiamond Intelligence Briefs, a trade publication.\\n   De Beers\\' South African interests face an uncertain future,\\nlargely because of a newly energized political will by the black\\nmajority in that country, an important diamond producer. The\\nAfrican National Congress has pledged to nationalize South Africa\\'s\\nmajor sources of wealth if it takes power.\\n   Apparently attempting to limit risk, De Beers recently announced\\nit would split South African and foreign interests into two\\npublicly held companies, one based in Switzerland.\\n   After growth spurts of 19 percent in 1987 and 35 percent in\\n1988, rough diamond sales fell 2 percent to $4.09 billion last year\\nbecause of slowing economies, high interest rates and the\\norganization\\'s two double-digit price increases in 1988 and 1989.\\n   The decline was sharpest in the second half of the year, when\\nsales fell 24 percent from the first six months.\\n   ``There was a very definite, noticeable slack in demand,\\'\\' said\\nanalyst Peter Miller of Yorkton Securities Inc. in London.\\n   The decline has limited De Beers\\' scope for raising prices. This\\npast week, De Beers announced it was increasing prices 5.5 percent,\\ncompared to a 15.5 percent increase a year earlier.\\n   The organization must this year renegotiate five-year contracts\\nwith Botswana, the second biggest diamond producer in terms of\\nvalue, and Argyle Diamonds of Western Australia, the biggest\\nproducer in terms of quantity.\\n   The government of newly independent Namibia, meanwhile, is\\nexpected to demand a one-fifth stake in Consolidated Diamond Mines,\\nDe Beers\\' Namibian subsidiary.\\n   The organization sells most of the Soviet Union\\'s West-bound\\ndiamonds, but the Soviets, the biggest value producer, have been\\nacting more independently and squeezing the cartel\\'s margins, the\\nexperts say.\\n   Jack Lunzer, managing director of IDC Ltd., an independent\\ndiamond distributor in London, said De Beers undoubtedly will\\ncontinue to control the major part of world production, but its\\nmarketing arm\\'s profits will fall.\\n   The effect hasn\\'t been felt yet; De Beers\\' profit rose 37\\npercent to $1.1 billion in 1989.\\n   Few diamond-producing countries dare sell their output outside\\nthe organization, and some bold enough to leave have returned\\nbecause of the difficulty in peddling diamonds alone.\\n   Zaire returned in 1983 after a two-year split. Angola, which\\nbroke in 1985, has been negotiating its re-entry.\\n   ``We are as strongly in control of the diamond market as we have\\nbeen for many years,\\'\\' said Tim Capon, the cartel\\'s director.\\n   The organization buys rough diamonds from De Beers\\' own mines,\\nwhich represent 30 percent of world production, and from producers\\nin Tanzania, South Africa, Zaire, Botswana, Namibia, Australia and\\nthe Soviet Union.\\n   It reveals few details about security. It was robbed once, in\\nthe early 1980s, when some diamonds were snatched as couriers\\ncarried them from one building to another.\\n   De Beers picks its 160 or so buying customers from thousands of\\nhopefuls. Ten times a year, at sales called ``sights,\\'\\' the clients\\nare offered a selection of diamonds chosen by the organization and\\nplaced in a simple cardboard box. The buyer basically can take it\\nor leave it.\\n   The gems then go to cutters in the world\\'s major diamond-cutting\\ncenters: Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; Antwerp, Belgium; and New\\nYork.\\n   Of all diamonds mined, only 15 percent will end up in jewelry,\\nbut these represent 80 percent of the value of the world\\'s diamond\\nproduction. The rest are put to industrial use.\\n   The organization is fighting the lackluster sales trend by\\ntrying to create new demand. Last year, it spent $160 million on\\nadvertising and promotion, trying, for example, to boost purchases\\nof men\\'s diamond jewelry.\\n   De Beers\\'s achievement over the decades has been to mass-market\\nwhat was once an aristocratic luxury without greatly diminishing\\nits value. Today, diamonds remain ``the gem of gems,\\'\\' although\\nmillions of people own them.\\n   De Beers insists it seeks long-term stability and prosperity for\\nthe industry, saying price fluctuations would undermine confidence\\nin the value of diamonds.\\n   So far, it has succeeded. While other commodities markets have\\nsuffered repeated convulsions, rough diamond prices haven\\'t fallen\\nsince the organization started announcing price changes in 1964.\\n   Even its fiercest competitors laud De Beers for putting up\\nconsiderable amounts of money and assuming the risks to develop\\nmines and support the market.\\n   During the early 1980s, when high interest rates caused the\\nworst diamond slump since the 1930s, the organization prevented the\\nmarket\\'s collapse by doubling its diamond stockpile to nearly $2\\nbillion worth.\\n   But producers criticize the organization\\'s secretiveness and\\nwhat they call its arbitrary valuation system. Some want more of\\nthe industry\\'s millions of jobs relocated in their own countries.\\n   Said Lunzer: ``It\\'s not unnatural for people in the producing\\ncountries to say, `Are we getting a proper share of the value of\\nour national resource?\\'\\'\\' After reviewing a complaint filed by the\\nBritish mining company Consolidated Gold Fields PLC alleging\\nanti-competitive practices, Britain\\'s Office of Fair Trading\\ndecided in August against formally investigating whether the\\norganization abuses its monopoly.\\n   Gold Fields acknowledged the complaint was a defensive maneuver\\nagainst a hostile, and ultimately unsuccessful, takeover bid from\\nOppenheimer-controlled Minorco SA last year.\\n   Formally known as De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., and based in\\nKimberley, South Africa, the company was formed in 1888 by the\\nBritish industrial colonialist Cecil Rhodes.\\n   Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, a diamond merchant, became chairman of\\nDe Beers in 1929 and five years later formed Diamond Trading Co.,\\nthe precursor of today\\'s cartel.\\n   Oppenheimer, who linked the diamond business with his extensive\\nAnglo American Corp. gold-mining interests, is credited with\\nsteering De Beers through the Depression.

States with large immigration populations may be adversely affected. Now a Senate-House conference committee will decide whether to attach the illegal immigrants ban to a 17.4 billion appropriations bill for the State, Commerce and Justice Departments. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher will request that President Bush veto any bill that includes the provisions against counting the illegal immigrants. The states of California, Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and others stand to loose congressional seats based on this Census count.\\nIntroduction:\\nIn a blow to California and other states with large immigrant populations, the \\nSenate voted Friday to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens in \\nthe 1990 population count. \\n\\n\"I\\'m stunned,\" said Santa Ana City Council member Miguel A. Pulido. Pulido and \\nother Santa Ana council members say that the 1980 census substantially \\nunder-counted its population at 215,000. The city has been lobbying hard to \\nhave its illegal alien population -- estimated at 50,000 -- included in the \\n1990 count. \\n\\nThe Senate\\'s action came on a voice vote, despite arguments from the Bush \\nAdministration and other opponents that it is both unconstitutional and \\nunworkable. Just before the voice vote, the senators voted, 50 to 41, against \\nkilling the proposal to bar aliens from the count. \\n\\nA Senate-House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against \\nincluding illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped \\nfrom a $17.4-billion appropriations bill for the State, Justice and Commerce \\ndepartments. \\n\\n\\nWould Urge Veto \\n\\nEven if the prohibition survives, Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher has \\nsaid that he would ask President Bush to veto any bill that comes to his desk \\nwith such a provision. \\n\\nAt stake are the number of seats in Congress for California, Florida, New York, \\nIllinois, Pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis \\nof next year\\'s census. \\n\\nFederal aid to states also is frequently based on population counts, so \\nmillions of dollars in grants and other funds made available on a per capita \\nbasis would be affected. \\n\\nState officials have said California could lose up to $300 million in federal \\naid if illegal aliens were uncounted. Santa Ana has estimated its potential \\nloss at $2 million a year. \\n\\nIn addition, Pulido and county advocates for poor Latino residents expressed \\nconcern that the decision would promote fear and intimidation in the community. \\n\\nIn 1985, before the federal immigration reform act, the number of illegal \\naliens in Orange County was estimated at 229,000, ranking it just behind Los \\nAngeles County in California, a county official said. There are no current \\nestimates. \\n\\n\"For example, we have close to 50,000 people in the city that have qualified \\nthrough the amnesty process for legal residency,\" Pulido said. \"Those \\nindividuals, when asked or challenged about their status, can be legitimately \\nconcerned. I think the census\\'s attempt to question them could be misconstrued \\nas an attempt by the immigration service to get information.\" \\n\\nCouncilman John Acosta said he \"was saddened\" by the Senate\\'s action because \\nthe city was determined \"to count every single person, and I know that (now) \\nwe\\'re going to to suffer from this monetarily.\" \\n\\nBut Pulido said he believes the House of Representatives will not allow the \\nprohibition to survive, especially since it killed an earlier, similar effort. \\n\\nThe issue cuts across partisan lines in the Senate, with Minority Leader Bob \\nDole (R-Kan.) arguing against the White House position on grounds that \\nincluding illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens. \\n\\n\\nLoss of Seats Cited \\n\\n\"Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens,\" Dole \\nargued. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said that Georgia and Indiana both lost \\nHouse seats after the 1980 Census, and that California and New York -- centers \\nof illegal immigration -- each gained seats. \\n\\n\"The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted,\" Cochran \\nsaid. \\n\\nSen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the \\ndecennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx \\nof immigration beyond the legal limits. \\n\\n\"There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of \\npopulation,\" Wilson said, adding that those states should receive additional \\nfederal aid to cope with the added problems. \\n\\nThe Senate\\'s action would also have an impact on smaller California cities \\nwithout substantial Latino populations because census population figures play \\nan important role in Community Development Block Grant formulas, said Don \\nVestal, Westminster city planner. \\n\\nWestminster is following a recommendation by the Census Bureau to form a \\nComplete Count Committee of officials and community leaders to help ensure \\ncooperation from all city residents. \\n\\n\"We feel that it\\'s in our best interest to get as complete a count as we can,\" \\nhe said. \\n\\nThe Community Development Block Grant formula, among other things, Vestal said, \\nincludes use of income figures and percentage of lower income residents in the \\ncity. \"In addition to just counting heads, they\\'re getting economic information \\nof the city that will affect us in the future,\" he added. \\n\\nGloria McDonough, director of Abrazar Center, an elderly-assistance center for \\nLatinos in Westminster, said the senators\\' action shows they have no \\nunderstanding of the impact of illegal immigration to California communities. \\n\\n\"Whether you count them or not, the undocumented residents are still going to \\nimpact federal dollars in our community. And whether we like it or not they\\'re \\nhere and here to stay,\" McDonough said. \\n\\nIn recent weeks, representatives from the census office in Santa Ana have \\nvisited such social centers as Abrazar and others and told center staff people \\nthat they intend to count \"everyone, regardless of where they came from,\" \\nMcDonough said. \\n\\n\"Their big thing was, \\'We do not care about the origins of where these people \\nare from, but, more importantly, their impact to local economies,\\' \" she said. \\n\\nWhen asked to comment, census officials in Santa Ana referred media inquiries \\nto the regional office in Van Nuys. \\n\\nAdrian Dove, assistant regional director for the U.S. Census in charge of \\noutreach, said that despite the Senate\\'s decision, the census bureau \"really \\ndoesn\\'t know how to go about finding who was legal or illegal.\" \\n\\n\"But we have a mandate to follow that law, and we would have to find out,\" he \\nsaid. \\n\\nOpponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical \\nbecause the Census Bureau has already printed questionnaires that do not \\ncontain any question about legality of residence. \\n\\nFor 190 years, said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the federal \\ngovernment has counted all inhabitants without regard to citizenship in \\naccordance with the Constitution\\'s provisions. \"Fiddling with the numbers\" now \\nwill destroy confidence in the census results, he added. \\n\\nThe Senate\\'s action was sharply criticized by Undersecretary of Commerce \\nMichael Darby, but he voiced hope that it would be reversed by a Senate-House \\nconference. \\n\\n\"There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be \\nunconstitutional but literally impossible,\" Darby said. \\n\\nBut he added that he is \"optimistic, cautiously optimistic,\" that House \\nconferees would resist the Senate-approved ban and not force Bush to veto the \\nlegislation. \\n\\nMario Moreno, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said he was \\nshocked by the Senate\\'s decision. \"It is going to have a dramatic and \\ndisastrous impact in the Hispanic community,\" Moreno said. \"People are going to \\nbe discouraged from participating.\" \\n\\nA Census Bureau spokesman took a more dispassionate view, however. \\n\\n\"Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence,\" said \\nbureau spokesman James Gorman. \"If Congress passes a law that says we will or \\nwill not count people, we will do what it says.\" \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThree hours of steady rain Monday provided a much-needed edge to crews working to douse a blaze in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming.

Four 20-person crews from Colorado, Utah and South Dakota were expected to arrive at the Shoshone fire by Monday night, putting the total number of firefighters to 430. At least 60 firefighters brought the Hiawatha forest fire under control Monday.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Three hours of steady rain Monday afternoon provided a\\nmuch-needed edge for crews working to douse a blaze that seared\\n1,650 acres in Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, and rainfall in\\nneighboring Yellowstone National Park calmed three smaller fires\\nthere.\\n   Meanwhile, illegal fireworks were blamed for causing a blaze\\nthat raged across 2,200 acres near Yosemite National Park in\\nCalifornia over the weekend, and firefighters brought a four-day\\nfire in Michigan\\'s Hiawatha National Forest under control Monday\\nafter the blaze consumed more than 1,100 acres.\\n   About a quarter-inch of rain helped to keep the lightning-caused\\nShoshone fire\\'s growth to about 200 acres overnight, said fire\\ninformation officer Dave Damron. But the nearly quarter-inch of\\nrain that fell Monday held it to 1,650 acres, he said.\\n   The rain also allowed officials to cancel a 100-man patrol\\nplanned for Monday night.\\n   ``The forecast for the next two or three days is dry, with lower\\nhumidities and conditions more favorable to burning,\\'\\' said Damron.\\n``But this provides a real good reprieve and a chance to reinforce\\nthe lines and complete lines that we don\\'t have yet.\\'\\'\\n   Four 20-person firefighting crews from Colorado, Utah and South\\nDakota were expected to arrive at the fire by Monday night, putting\\nthe total number of firefighters at about 430.\\n   Crews were attacking the fire from both the ground and the air,\\nDamron said, as four helicopters and three air tankers dropped\\nchemical retardant and water on the spreading flames. On the ground\\nfirefighters were aided by six engines and four bulldozers.\\n   Meanwhile at Yellowstone, park spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said\\nthat because the three fires there all were in the backcountry, no\\nfirefighters were trying to douse the flames.\\n   Because of the fires, park officials Sunday had closed off some\\nareas, but Vanderbilt said Monday the rain had allowed the\\nreopening of the areas to hiking and camping.\\n   The cause of the fire near Stanislaus National Forest, near\\nYosemite, was a ``bottle rocket,\\'\\' said the forest\\'s spokeswoman,\\nMary Hale.\\n   Firefighters, aided by lower temperatures and higher humidity,\\nreported the smoky blaze 90 percent contained Monday afternoon and\\nhoped to have a line surrounding the fire early Tuesday morning,\\nHale said.\\n   The fire was the largest so far this year in the forest, which\\nwas the scene of huge wildfires last summer.\\n   At least 60 Forest Service firefighters brought the Hiawatha\\nforest fire under control Monday, spokesman Dale Bluedorn said from\\nthe national forest\\'s headquarters in Escanaba, Mich.\\n   ``We\\'re going to start releasing crews from this fire,\\'\\'\\nBluedorn said. ``We\\'ll continue to patrol the area to make sure we\\ndidn\\'t miss any hot spots.\\'\\'\\n   Bluedorn said continued hot, dry weather means it could be weeks\\nbefore the fire is extinguished.\\n   ``It may not be declared out until there\\'s a three-day rain,\\'\\'\\nhe said.\\n   The Fourth of July was no holiday for firefighters from national\\nforests in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho and other states who were\\nshipped to Michigan\\'s central Upper Peninsula to battle the\\nHiawatha blaze, Bluedorn said.\\n   Forest Service officials, meanwhile, began assessing damage to\\nthe 920 acres of national forest and 210 acres of private woodlands\\nburned after the fire broke out Friday afternoon, Bluedorn said.\\n   Investigators have ruled out lightning as the cause.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nVirginia Thomas, wife of the nominee to the Supreme Court, has come under scrutiny and is the target of some criticism. Critics see her as a woman with strong opinions on issues likely to come before the court. She has represented the conservative views in her work on the staff of a Republican Congressman.

Some religious rights groups are troubled by her\\nanti-cult activities in light of her former involvement with Lifespring, a\\nmotivational group.\\nSkin color an issue; Even the color of her skin is\\nbeing used to determine the content of Clarence Thomas\\'s character. The fact\\nthat she is white has drawn criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as\\nevidence that Clarence Thomas has rejected his roots.\\nIn their respective\\ncareers, the Thomases have embraced the view that women and minorities are\\nhindered, rather than helped, by affirmative action and government programs.\\nTrue equality is achieved by holding everyone to the same standard, they\\nbelieve.\\n\"I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to say she\\'s anti-women\\'s rights,\" said\\nRicky Silberman, vice chairwoman of the EEOC and a friend of the Thomases. She\\nsaid Virginia Thomas opposed legislation on comparable worth because it would\\nhave involved the government in determining wages, which is \"not good for the\\neconomy, not good for workers, not good for women.\"\\nConservative viewpoint;\\nVirginia Thomas has represented the conservative viewpoint in her jobs as a\\nstaffer for a Republican congressman, spokeswoman at the U.S. Chamber of\\nCongress and deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Labor.\\nClarence Thomas advocates a colorblind society, and his marriage may be an\\nexample of that philosophy. But others see a different symbolism.\\n\"His\\nmarrying a white woman is a sign of his rejection of the black community,\"\\nsaid Russell Adams, chairman of Howard University\\'s department of\\nAfro-American studies. \"Great justices have had community roots that served as\\na basis for understanding the Constitution. Clarence\\'s lack of a sense of\\ncommunity makes his nomination troubling.\"\\nReligious leaders wonder; Some\\nreligious leaders are troubled as well. Dean Kelley, the National Council of\\nChurches\\' counselor on religious liberty, wrote a critique of Clarence Thomas\\nthat was used as grounds for his organization\\'s opposition to the Supreme\\nCourt nominee. The author did not mention Virginia Thomas in his text, but has\\nsaid he was concerned about her involvement in the Cult Awareness Network\\n(CAN), a Chicago-based organization that says it educates the public about\\n\"destructive\" cults. That involvement, he said, might affect her husband\\'s\\nhandling of religious-liberty cases if he shares her views on the subject.\\nDuring the early \\'80s, Virginia Thomas enrolled in Lifespring, a self-help\\ncourse that challenges students to take responsibility for their lives. A\\nsmall percentage of the program\\'s 300,000 graduates have been deeply disturbed\\nby Lifespring\\'s methods, which involve intense emotional self-examination.\\nA clean break; Virginia Thomas was troubled by some of Lifespring\\'s activities\\nand eventually broke with the organization. Since 1985, she has been a public\\nadvocate against cult activities.\\nWhen she served as a labor-relations\\nattorney at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce from 1985 to 1989, she represented\\nthe interests of the business community at congressional hearings on such\\nissues as comparable worth, affirmative action and federal child-care\\nlegislation.  \\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAnti-abortion demonstrators charge that police in more than 50 cities have used excessive force against them. Retired Roman Catholic Bishop George Lynch of New York vividly described the pain suffered when he was apprehended by West Hartford, Conn. police in 1989. The demonstrators claim that police tactics in Denver, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and Los Angeles have resulted in serious injury and led to sexual abuse against women who have been arrested. While the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police has led to widespread calls for investigation of police brutality, little attention has been directed to police brutality and abuse suffered by the anti-abortion demonstrators.\\nIntroduction:\\nTHE 74-year-old man said it was \"like needles or nails being stuck in\" when\\npolice handcuffed him behind his back as he lay face down. Then the police\\nlifted him by his arms and dragged him from the scene.\\nRetired Roman\\nCatholic Bishop George Lynch of New York was describing his treatment by West\\nHartford, Conn., police during a 1989 anti-abortion demonstration.  \\n\\nIn mid-June, a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department was\\nsettled when police agreed to stop using a martial-arts weapon, nunchakus,\\nwhile arresting anti-abortion advocates.\\nHundreds have charged that police\\nin more than 50 cities have used excessive force in removing demonstrators\\nintent on closing down abortion facilities. The demonstrators, most associated\\nwith Operation Rescue, have charged and testified that police tactics used\\nduring the past 2 1/2 years in cities such as Denver, Atlanta, Pittsburgh and\\nLos Angeles have resulted in serious injury and led to sexual abuse against\\nwomen who have been arrested.\\nOperation Rescue, which draws participants\\nlargely from conservative Catholic and Protestant circles, is a national\\nmovement that organizes demonstrations at abortion facilities. It is the\\npractice of the protesters to go limp when ordered to move but to otherwise\\noffer no resistance to police.\\nThe persistent complaints and numerous\\nsuits against police by Operation Rescue have taken on a new significance in\\nrecent months in the wake of the Los Angeles police beating of motorist Rodney\\nKing.\\nThe images of Los Angeles police swinging nightsticks at King as he\\nlay on the ground, played repeatedly on national news programs, were burned\\ninto the national conscience and led to widespread calls for investigation of\\npolice brutality.\\nBut government agencies, the press and civil\\nlibertarians have reacted quite differently to Operation Rescue videos showing\\napparent police brutality and to reports of police abuse of hundreds of the\\nactivists across the country.\\nA videotape of an Operation Rescue\\ndemonstration shows a man\\'s arm apparently snapping under the pressure of\\nbeing lifted in a manner similar to that used on Lynch. Other scenes show\\npolice apparently placing fingers into the nostrils of one demonstrator and\\ngrabbing the breast of a female protester to force compliance.\\nThe\\nsettlement over police use of nunchakus in Los Angeles, like the videos and\\nphotographs showing police using pain compliance techniques on Rescue\\nparticipants, received little attention from the public, civil rights groups\\nor the press. Some critics say the lack of attention is a sign of a double\\nstandard.\\nPolice, including Assistant Chief Craig Carrucci of West\\nHartford, deny the claims of brutality. The FBI investigated complaints of\\nmisconduct by members of his department, he said, and \"every single case was\\nclosed.\"\\nHe called pain compliance \"a valid tool\" used \"in direct\\nproportion to the amount of resistance.\" Even Gandhi and Martin Luther King\\nJr., when arrested, cooperated with police and the courts, he said.\\nShortly after Rodney King\\'s beating, a news program on ABC illustrating police\\nbrutality showed a still photo of police using a martial-arts weapon against a\\nperson being arrested, but there was no mention that the episode involved\\nOperation Rescue.\\nSimilarly, the CBS Evening News reported March 27 \"on\\nvarious aspects of police brutality\" but did not include examples involving\\nanti-abortion activists, a producer said.\\n\"It (police abuse) has not\\nattracted much attention because a lot of people are not sympathetic to\\nOperation Rescue,\" said Dr. James Fyfe, a professor of justice at American\\nUniversity in Washington, D.C.\\nPolice may also have a predisposition to\\nuse excessive force against the anti-abortion activists, said Fyfe, a former\\nNew York City policeman. Their tactics -- going limp and in some cases\\nchaining themselves to buildings -- are \"a little more than police are used to\\ndealing with.\"\\nDr. Philip Wogaman, professor of Christian social ethics at\\nWesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C.believes the comparison with\\nother kinds of protests breaks down at several points. For instance, he said,\\ncivil rights demonstrators normally were picketing to assert their right to\\neat at a lunch counter or ride on a bus, not closing facilities to deny the\\nrights of others.\\nAs early as 1989, soon after Operation Rescue began\\nwidespread sit-ins to disrupt abortion facilities, William B. Allen, then\\nchairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, sounded an alarm. \"I am\\nconcerned that anti-abortion protesters are receiving selective prosecution\\nand selectively harsh treatment, unlike that received by other demonstrators\\nfor other causes,\" said Allen, who generally opposes abortion.\\nColleen\\nO\\'Connor, the American Civil Liberties Union\\'s national public education\\ndirector, and Carol Sobel, the ACLU\\'s senior staff counsel in Los Angeles,\\nsaid they agree that police have abused Operation Rescue participants. The\\nACLU is supporting Operation Rescue in some of those situations, they said.\\n But the civil liberties group is clearly caught between conflicting rights.\\nThe ACLU may support some of Operation Rescue\\'s claims of police brutality,\\nbut Sobel said it also has won a $110,000 judgment in a case in which the ACLU\\nhad obtained an injunction against the anti-abortion group.\\nThe Civil\\nRights Commission in 1989, under pressure from some members of Congress,\\ndecided against an investigation of alleged police brutality against\\nanti-abortion activists and decided not to ask the Justice Department to\\ninvestigate.\\nA commission spokeswoman said its legal mandate prohibits\\ndealing with abortion issues. Critics of the commission\\'s decision not to\\ninvestigate say the issue was, and is, police brutality, not abortion.  \\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe prediction of a major earthquake along the New Madrid Fault is causing a stir in Tennessee. Some to plan to leave the area; there are plans to close schools and businesses in December and others are crowding into earthquake survival classes. This is a result of a prediction by Iben Browning, a scientist who predicted the Bay Area and Mexico City quakes. This area suffered a series of earthquakes in 1811 and 1812 estimated to be higher than an 8 on the then non-existent Richter scale. The New Madrid fault is 120 miles long.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Friday nights used to be slow at The\\nFault Line, a nightclub here on busy Poplar Avenue. But after\\nword spread that a major earthquake was forecast for Dec. 3\\nin the Midwest, The Fault Line began throwing earthquake\\nparties.\\n\\nOn Friday nights now, hundreds of patrons pour into the\\nclub to swig \"Earthquake shooters\" and sign up to win Dec. 3\\nEarthquake Escape Packages to the Bahamas or Hot Springs,\\nArk.\\n\\nBut even as Memphians whoop it up, the prediction that the\\nBig One may come in December is triggering tremors up and\\ndown the Mississippi Valley. Shaken, thousands of people are\\ncrowding into earthquake survival classes. In Arnold, Mo.,\\n3,000 people showed up for one course.\\n\\nIn Missouri and Arkansas, some schools and businesses have\\nannounced plans to close in early December. Entrepreneurs are\\nhawking quake insurance, survival kits and gas-line safety\\ngadgets.\\n\\nSome people are planning to flee. \"You can\\'t run from\\neverything,\" says Tammy McCormick, a nurse in Blytheville,\\nArk., who will take her two youngsters and spend several days\\nwith relatives in North Carolina. \"But it seems stupid to\\nstay on a fault line with a prediction like this.\"\\n\\nEverybody talks about the San Andreas fault in California.\\nBut the Midwest actually has had three of the most powerful\\nearthquakes on this continent. In 1811 and 1812, along a\\n120-mile zig-zag formation called the New Madrid fault, a\\nseries of quakes ravaged the Midwest. Researchers estimate\\nthose earthquakes ranked stronger than 8 on the Richter\\nScale, which hadn\\'t been invented yet. They were more than 10\\ntimes greater than the 7.1 quake that rocked California\\'s Bay\\nArea last October.\\n\\nChurch bells rang as far away as Boston. Chimneys crumbled\\nin Cincinnati. And as tons of soil and rock bed pitched and\\nrolled in a seismic frenzy, new waterfalls spiked up, causing\\npart of the mighty Mississippi River to flow backward for\\nseveral hours.\\n\\nThe New Madrid (pronounced MAD-rid) fault still has 150\\nsmall, mostly unfelt, earthquakes a year. In the next 10\\nyears, experts warn, the area has a 33% chance of a quake\\nmeasuring 7.1. That could produce billions of dollars in\\ndamage and thousands of casualties. \"We\\'re overdue for one in\\nthe 6s and low 7s,\" says David Stewart, an earthquake expert\\nat Southeast Missouri State University.\\n\\nOver the years, a few pinpoint-on-the map towns have tried\\nto capitalize on the little-known fault. New Madrid, Mo., the\\nfault\\'s namesake, draws tourists to a museum with exhibits on\\nthe 19th century devastation. And Paragould, Ark., has held\\nearthquake festivals with events like the \"Miss Faultless\"\\nbeauty contest.\\n\\nBut as Monday, Dec. 3, approaches, the whole matter is\\nbecoming more serious. That\\'s because the predictor has\\ngained credibility in some important circles for his work on\\nthe climate.\\n\\nIben Browning, a 72-year-old scientist, predicted\\nOctober\\'s Bay Area quake a week before it happened, say\\npeople who heard him speak to the Equipment Manufacturers\\nInstitute. And he predicted \"geological danger\" on Sept. 19,\\n1985, along a band of latitude that included Mexico City --\\nwhere a massive quake struck on that day.\\n\\nMr. Browning, who has a Ph.D. in physiology, genetics and\\nbacteriology, writes a climate newsletter out of New Mexico.\\nHe has clients, such as PaineWebber Inc., who have long paid\\nfor his wisdom on how the weather will affect their\\nagricultural investments.\\n\\nSince 1971, Mr. Browning says, he has picked the correct\\ndates of four large earthquakes, two volcanoes -- and one day\\nwith both a volcano and an earthquake.\\n\\nHe bases his forecasts on tidal forces caused by the\\npositions of the sun and the moon -- an old theory, critics\\nsay, that doesn\\'t wash. On Dec. 3, those forces are expected\\nto be at a 27-year high. Mr. Browning says that will exert\\npressure that could trigger faults already ripe to fail.\\n\\nThe New Madrid area has a 50-50 chance of producing at\\nleast a 7 quake on Dec. 3, give or take a day or two on\\neither side, Mr. Browning says. At that time, a similar quake\\nhas a lesser chance of occurring on California\\'s San Andreas\\nor Hayward faults, according to Mr. Browning, and an 8.2\\nquake in Tokyo has a greater chance.\\n\\nSkepticism abounds. \"No responsible scientist can predict\\nan exact day for an earthquake,\" says Brian Mitchell, a quake\\nexpert at St. Louis University, echoing the majority opinion.\\n\\nBut Mr. Browning shouldn\\'t be written off so quickly, says\\nSoutheast Missouri State\\'s Mr. Stewart, who recently spent\\nfour days with Mr. Browning. \"He has a methodology that can\\ndetermine, plus or minus a window of a day or two, an\\nenhanced probability of a volcano or an earthquake in certain\\nlatitudes,\" says Mr. Stewart. \"No one else has been able to\\nreplicate it, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s wrong.\"\\n\\nMr. Browning says it\\'s not easy being on record with\\npredictions that few other scientists will support. \"I feel\\nlike a lonely little petunia in a cabbage patch,\" he says.\\nBut asked if he enjoys being right, he says, \"It\\'s the only\\ndamn thing that matters. If one is a business consultant,\\nthey don\\'t pay you for being wrong.\"\\n\\nPlenty of other business people are cashing in on his\\nprediction. Insurance salespeople are peddling earthquake\\ncoverage to homeowners and businesses. Salespeople from a\\nMemphis company pop up at survival seminars with a device\\n(for $259 and up) that turns off gas lines when a quake hits.\\nAnd entrepreneurs are marketing two kinds of earthquake\\nT-shirts in Memphis. One says, \"I\\'m staying,\" the other, \"I\\'m\\nleaving.\"\\n\\nAll of this has changed life in places like Blytheville,\\nArk. (pop: 24,314), tucked amid vast flat farmland, right at\\nthe corner of the Arkansas, Tennessee and Missouri borders.\\n\\nSo many people plan to skip town on Dec. 3 that the\\nFlexible Technologies tubing plant already plans to shut down\\nfor two days, at a cost of thousands of dollars. Says Jimmy\\nConnell, plant superintendent, \"It\\'s going to be a ghost town\\naround here.\"\\n\\nRobert Edwards, a Blytheville fireman who teaches seminars\\nin earthquake survival, has become a hot property. For five\\nyears, most of his classes were lightly attended. Now his\\nphone-answering machine says he is almost completely booked\\nthrough October.\\n\\nFor one recent class, he was in Osceola, Ark. It is 9 a.m.\\non a rainy Saturday, and 325 Osceolans, gripping legal pads\\nand spiral notebooks, fill the high school auditorium for an\\nall-day session on earthquake preparedness. With his booming\\nvoice, Mr. Edwards lays out a grim scenario: \"One hundred and\\nfifty thousand dead in Memphis instantly -- instantly. And\\nall the federal emergency help is going to go there and St.\\nLouis. You have to be prepared to take complete care of\\nyourself for 24 hours to two weeks. You may be five to six\\nmonths without power.\"\\n\\nAfter the seminar, two elderly sisters, both widows, split\\non what to do. Fearing their home will be looted, Bess Mann,\\n86 years old, wants to ride it out. But her sister, Hallie\\nPeterson, 83, wants to stay with their nephew in Mississippi.\\nScared that the big Memphis-Arkansas bridge that spans the\\nMississippi River will collapse in a quake, she\\'s charting an\\nalternate route two hours out of her way.\\n\\nSchool districts in Earle and Wilson, Ark., have announced\\nclosings around Dec. 3. Some schools practice earthquake\\ndrills, while others sponsor cake sales to buy survival kits\\nfor classrooms, with items like blankets, flashlights and\\nradios.\\n\\nMichael Prince, a child psychologist in Jonesboro, says he\\nknows of 10 to 15 children, age four to nine, so unnerved\\nthat they\\'ve reverted to bed-wetting or extreme anxiety about\\nbeing separated from their parents.\\n\\nTrying to calm the fear, the National Earthquake\\nPrediction Evaluation Council, a panel of academic and\\ngovernment seismic experts, will review the Browning claim at\\na meeting in a few weeks. In 11 years of studying prediction\\nmethods, the panel has found no bona fide approach. The group\\nusually ignores claims that aren\\'t scientifically documented\\n(like the one by the California man who said his goldfish\\nhelped him predict quakes).\\n\\n\"But this one,\" says Randall Updike, the executive\\nsecretary, \"has created such chaos in the mid-continent\\nregion that we felt we had to give our advice.\"\\n\\nMr. Browning says he is tentatively booked to give a talk\\nin Minneapolis on Dec. 3 and he doesn\\'t plan to go there via\\nSt. Louis. But he adds: \"I highly recommend against panic.\\nThat will kill more people than earthquakes.\"\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nHurricane Hugo got the public\\'s attention. It caused an unprecedented $10B in damage, killed 28 people in the Lesser Antilles, and 29 in South Carolina. But it could have been more deadly if it hit almost any place else. Early warnings about Hugo allowed 350,000 people to be evacuated safely. Hugo was the worst hurricane to strike the southeastern US coast since Betsy hit Florida in 1965, killing 74. Since then, the population of areas such as south Florida has ballooned and most residents have never directly experienced a hurricane.

He will ask the Board of Supervisors to pass a resolution supporting his position. If the approximate 200,000 illegal aliens were not counted, the county would loose an estimated $56 million a year in federal revenue and lose representatives in Congress. On Thursday, the U.S. Senate and House agreed that illegal aliens should be counted. Before Thursday, the Senate had voted to bar the Census Bureau from counting illegal aliens. The House had twice rejected efforts to exclude aliens.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe director of the county Social Services Agency wants all Orange County \\nresidents, including illegal aliens, to be counted in the 1990 Census, and he \\nwill ask the Board of Supervisors to support his position. \\n\\nA resolution doing just that will be introduced at the supervisors\\' meeting \\nTuesday. Agency officials said that if illegal aliens were to be excluded from \\nthe count, it would mean that, on paper, the county had 200,000 fewer residents \\nthan the county\\'s actual population. That lower figure would result in the loss \\nof an estimated $56 million a year in federal revenue, they said. \\n\\nIn a letter to the supervisors, Larry Leaman, director of the agency, urged the \\nboard to adopt the resolution supporting a complete count of all county \\nresidents and opposing \"all attempts to systematically exclude any groups from \\nthe census.\" \\n\\nSuch exclusions, the letter said, could result in the county losing \\nrepresentatives in Congress because districts are determined by population. \\n\\nJust Thursday, efforts to include illegal aliens in the Census received a major \\nboost when negotiators from the U.S. Senate and House agreed on the issue. \\nBefore Thursday\\'s action, the Senate had voted to bar the Census Bureau from \\ncounting illegal aliens, although the House had twice rejected efforts to \\nexclude aliens. The agreement worked out Thursday at the House-Senate \\nconference will go back to each body before it is sent to President Bush, but \\nit is considered likely to be approved. \\n\\nOrange County officials contend that much is at stake in whether aliens are \\nincluded in the count. In 1985, before the Federal Immigration Reform Act, the \\nnumber of illegal aliens in the county was estimated at 300,000. \\n\\nIn Santa Ana, home to 44.5% of the county\\'s Latinos, city officials worried \\nabout the ramifications of undercounting its residents. They figured that in \\nthe 1980 Census, the city was shortchanged by at least 50,000 people. If those \\nresidents had been included, it could have meant another $2.2 million in state \\nand federal revenue, according to city officials. GEORGE FRANK \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAs hurricane Andrew headed west along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, government officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday urged more than two million people to evacuate coastal areas. The likeliest landfall is to the west of New Orleans, a city particularly vulnerable to flooding since it lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through it, and has a large lake immediately to its north. In Florida, Andrew hit hardest 10-15 miles south of Miami, leveling the town of Homestead and a nearby air force base. It was estimated today that damage from Andrew could reach $20 billion.\\nIntroduction:\\nDAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it was\\nestimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US storms this century\\nthreatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans.\\nGovernment officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas yesterday advised\\nor ordered more than 2m people to evacuate coastal areas.\\nThe hurricane tore through southern Florida early on Monday morning, causing\\nbillions of dollars of property damage and at least 12 deaths, and yesterday\\nwas moving north-west across the Gulf of Mexico with winds of about 140\\nmiles an hour.\\nAt least three people died on Sunday when Hurricane Andrew crossed the\\nBahamas.\\nMs Kate Hale, director of emergency services in Florida\\'s Dade County, which\\nbore the brunt of the storm, estimated that Andrew had already caused\\nDollars 15bn to Dollars 20bn (Pounds 7.5bn-Pounds 10bn) of damage.\\nHowever, insurance industry analysts cautioned that it was too early to\\nassess the costs accurately. The US industry\\'s Property Claims Service, the\\nofficial compiler of disaster losses, had yet to compile a preliminary tally\\nof the Florida bill.\\nA hurricane warning was in effect yesterday along 470 miles of Gulf coast\\nfrom Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Galvestone, Texas.\\nSeveral forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in central\\nLouisiana, to the west of New Orleans, possibly late last night or this\\nmorning.\\nNew Orleans, with a population of 1.6m, is particularly vulnerable because\\nthe city lies below sea level, has the Mississippi River running through its\\ncentre and a large lake immediately to the north.\\nMuch of America\\'s oil refining industry is concentrated along coastal Texas\\nand Louisiana and several refineries were yesterday partially shut down.\\nThese included British Petroleum\\'s Belle Chasse plant in Louisiana.\\nIn Florida, Andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some\\n10-15 miles south of Miami. The town of Homestead, near the centre of the\\nstorm, was largely flattened, including a local air force base.\\nMiami\\'s city centre escaped with relatively light damage. More than 24 hours\\nafter the hurricane, some 825,000 households and businesses were still\\nwithout power.\\nThe brunt of insurance claims from the Florida storm will fall on the US\\nindustry, and companies with a heavy local exposure include the State Farm\\nGroup and the Allstate Insurance unit of Sears Roebuck. These are also the\\nleading property/casualty and home insurance groups in Louisiana, together\\nwith American International Group.\\nA spokesman for State Farm Insurance said he believed the company had\\nroughly 20 per cent of the Florida market. The mutually-owned company has no\\nreinsurance. Its size has made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and its\\nreserves, at about Dollars 24bn, have made it unnecessary.\\nAccording to Balcombe Group, a UK-based claims adjustment firm, other\\ninsurers with large exposure in the hurricane-hit area are Hartford\\nInsurance, Aetna and Travellers. Travellers said it had flown 50 claims\\nadjusters in to Florida late on Monday and was assessing losses. About 12\\nper cent of Travellers\\' home insurance premium income came from Florida last\\nyear, and 4.6 per cent of its commercial insurance premiums.\\nThe last serious US hurricane, Hugo, which struck South Carolina in 1989,\\ncost the industry Dollars 4.2bn from insured losses, though estimates of the\\ntotal damage caused ranged between Dollars 6bn and Dollars 10bn.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nLess than a month before the 1990 elections, a third presidential candidate in Colombia, Carlos Pizarro, was assassinated in a jetliner taking off from Bogota by a gunman on a suicide mission. Pizarro\\'s bodyguards killed the assassin. The assassination of the other two candidates was blamed on drug traffickers. The media, citing security sources, reported that traffickers were the main suspects in Pizarro\\'s killing as well. The Medallion cartel denied involvement. Traffickers have killed nearly 300 Colombians in the past nine months in an effort to halt the government\\'s campaign to capture and expedite drug barons to the United States.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Less than a month before elections, the\\nassassination of a third presidential candidate has pushed Colombia\\nto the brink of political chaos.\\n   After the shooting of candidate Carlos Pizarro in a jetliner\\nThursday, the country\\'s largest newspaper implored the government\\nto ``do something, for the love of God.\\'\\'\\n   Addressing President Virgilio Barco, the El Tiempo editorial\\nsaid: ``In your hands, and only in your hands, is the power to\\navoid the country\\'s dissolution.\\'\\'\\n   ``The gravest aspect of Colombia\\'s bloodletting is that the\\ngovernment has no idea how to even slow it,\\'\\' said a member of a\\nregional human rights committee based in Medellin, the cocaine\\ncapital.\\n   He declined to be identified because he was afraid someone might\\nbe angered by his statements and kill him. Four of his predecessors\\nhave been assassinated.\\n   In recent interviews, Pizarro, the candidate for the leftist\\nApril 19 Movement, or M-19, admitted he was afraid.

Specifically, whether illegal aliens should be counted in the 1990 Census. The Census Bureau maintains that an accurate count will not be possible if the illegal immigrants are left out. There could be enough aliens to shift seats from up to five states to Sun Belt states with large alien populations. The government estimated that there are more than 2.57 million illegal aliens living throughout the nation. The Senatorial debate may force a Supreme Court ruling on this constitutional issue.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Simply put, the question was who should be\\ncounted as a person and who, if anybody, should not. But there\\'s\\nnothing simple about it.\\n   The Senate voted one answer and, in effect, invited the Supreme\\nCourt to decide whether it was right or wrong.\\n   That happened because in the arithmetic of congressional\\nreapportionment, every question becomes complex, contentious and\\npolitically charged.\\n   The point at issue in Senate debate on a new immigration bill was\\nwhether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will\\nreallocate House seats among states after the 1990 census. There\\ncould be enough of them to shift seats away from at least five\\nstates to Sun Belt states with large numbers of illegal residents.\\n   Nobody is certain because counting illegal aliens is a hard thing\\nto do, given the fact that they don\\'t want to be spotted by the\\ngovernment. Then again, the Census Bureau maintains that not\\nincluding them, and still coming up with an accurate 1990 population\\ncount, would be even more difficult. ``A census of only legal\\nresidents cannot be done as accurately as a census of all\\nresidents,\\'\\' according to Census Bureau testimony to Congress.\\n   After the 1980 census, the government estimated that there were\\n2.57 million people in the United States illegally. There were other\\nguesses, some of them far higher. The government made no attempt to\\ncount them out in the redistricting process; indeed, the two\\nprevious administrations decided that the Constitution required that\\nthe census cover illegal aliens along with citizens.\\n   There is not likely to be any change in that prior to the 1990\\ncensus next spring. The Senate has passed an immigration bill\\nincluding an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the\\nredistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear Congress before\\nthe next year\\'s national head count.\\n   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., proposed, and won, the immigration\\nbill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the\\nredistricting process. It would give Secretary of Commerce Robert\\nMosbacher the assignment of adjusting the census figures so that\\nillegal aliens don\\'t count for purposes of redistributing House\\nseats. It does not come with instructions, so the department would\\nhave to figure out how.\\n   Shelby\\'s amendment says only that the secretary is to ``make such\\nadjustments in total population figures as may be necessary, using\\nsuch methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and\\nappropriate\\'\\' to keep illegal aliens from being counted in\\ncongressional reapportionment.\\n   That task would be perilous politically, since it would involve\\ntaking House seats away from some states and giving them to others,\\nall on the basis of estimates. With 435 seats in the House, every\\nrepresentative gained by a state is a representative lost by another.\\n   Opponents of the Shelby amendment, led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,\\nD-Mass., said it was unconstitutional, as well as unworkable. ``The\\nframers of the Constitution intended to count all persons,\\'\\' Kennedy\\nsaid.\\n   The Constitution itself says the apportionment of the House is to\\nbe determined on the basis of ``the whole number of free persons,\\'\\'\\nexcluding Indians and counting every five slaves as three persons.\\nThat was amended after the Civil War to say that the apportionment\\nof House seats will be based on ``the whole number of persons in\\neach state.\\'\\'\\n   Neither the original article nor the amendment mentions\\ncitizenship in connection with apportionment, although the term\\n``citizens\\'\\' is used in some other provisions. Opponents of the\\namendment said that showed the authors of both documents wanted\\neverybody counted for purposes of apportionment.\\n   But Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., said the people who wrote the\\ndocuments had no concept of illegal aliens because there weren\\'t any\\nin their time.\\n   That came later, with immigration restrictions that began in 1875.\\n   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said the question\\nshould be put squarely to the Supreme Court. He said it is unfair to\\ncount illegal aliens in reapportionment. ``It just does not make any\\nsense,\\'\\' Dole said. ``It does violate the constitutional principle\\nof one man, one vote.\\'\\'\\n   But opponents of the Shelby measure said apportionment doesn\\'t\\ninvolve who votes and who doesn\\'t. Women couldn\\'t vote when the\\nConstitution and the 14th Amendment were adopted, but they always\\nwere counted. Children can\\'t vote, but they count, too.\\n   The amendment was adopted after the Senate voted 58 to 41 against\\na move to reject it, and 56 to 43 against scuttling it as\\nunconstitutional.\\n   Shelby said that is sure to put the matter into the hands of the\\ncourts for a final judgment. ``Somebody is going to challenge it\\n...\\'\\' he said. ``Then, for the first time, we will let the Supreme\\nCourt of the United States decide something that we need an answer\\nto ...\\'\\'\\n   Walter R.

A partial solar eclipse was visible today across much of western North America. Dozens of people watched it through two types of solar telescopes at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Scientists warn against staring at the sun directly or through inadequate filters. During this event the greatest blockage of the sun, 80%, occurred in Anchorage, Alaska. For any single spot on earth, a partial eclipse occurs every several years. Total solar eclipses at any single location occur roughly every four centuries, though they are visible from somewhere on earth about every two years.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Solar telescopes yielded views of\\nflare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon\\nTuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible\\nacross western North America.\\n   ``There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,\\'\\' said\\nEd Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, where 600\\nchildren and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37\\npercent of the sun\\'s surface at 10:50 a.m. PST.\\n   ``It was certainly a lively crowd,\\'\\' he said. ``There was a\\nfestival atmosphere.\\'\\'\\n   ``It\\'s kind of neat,\\'\\' said map maker Jan Mayne, who was among\\ndozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar\\ntelescopes at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\\n   As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial\\neclipse, those watching through Caltech\\'s telescopes could see\\nmountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun. Also\\nvisible were gas jets on the sun\\'s surface and a giant group of\\nsunspots that on Monday produced the most intense solar flare _ a\\nburst of heat and radiation _ since 1984.\\n   ``There was a stunning view of that large sunspot group,\\'\\' Krupp\\nsaid.\\n   The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a\\ndiagonal line stretching roughly from Mazatlan, Mexico, northeast to\\nDallas and Chicago.\\n   Views were best farther west and north. But because the eclipse\\nwas partial most people didn\\'t notice the slight dimming of sunlight.\\n   ``You can\\'t tell the difference between a partial eclipse and a\\nsecond-stage smog alert,\\'\\' joked one observer at Caltech.\\n   Several people viewed the eclipse through welder\\'s helmets in\\ndowntown Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of\\nthe sun at 9:13 a.m. AST.\\n   In San Francisco, the moon eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 9:52\\na.m., but the event wasn\\'t visible because of clouds that were so\\nthick they delayed arriving flights at the airport.\\n   A slight dimming was noticed in Seattle, where partly cloudy\\nskies allowed a glimpse of the 56 percent eclipse at 10:10 a.m. PST.\\n   The percentage of the sun blocked out and time of maximum eclipse\\nat other locations included 52 percent at 11:28 a.m. MST in\\nEdmonton, Alberta; 46 percent at 11:09 a.m. MST in Boise, Idaho; 36\\npercent at 11:10 a.m. MST in Salt Lake City; 35 percent at 9:58 a.m.\\nPST in Las Vegas; 25 percent at 11:17 a.m. MST in Denver; 15 percent\\nat 12:42 p.m. CST in Minneapolis, and a measly 3 percent at 12:44\\np.m. CST in Milwaukee.\\n   Fearful that people would suffer eye damage during the eclipse,\\nscientists warned against staring at the sun directly or through\\ninadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic film or\\nfilters.\\n   Alan MacRobert, spokesman for Sky &amp; Telescope magazine, said\\nthere were 245 known eye injuries in the United States after an\\neclipse in 1970, but warnings about the danger reduced the number to\\nthree during a 1984 partial eclipse.\\n   From any single spot on Earth, a partial eclipse occurs every\\nseveral years, said Ken Libbrecht, as assistant professor of\\nastrophysics at Caltech.\\n   Total solar eclipses are visible from any single location roughly\\nonce every four centuries, though they are visible about every two\\nyears from somewhere on Earth, he said.\\n   The next total eclipse will happen July 11, 1991, sweeping across\\nHawaii, the Pacific Ocean, lower Baja California in Mexico, the west\\ncoast of Central America and finally Colombia and Brazil, MacRobert\\nsaid.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nUS track and field officials said that Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100 meter dash.

Carl Lewis said that while Johnson had not told the truth earlier, he was doing so now and speaking out against drugs and should be allowed back in the sport after he finishes his suspension.\\nIntroduction:\\nBen Johnson should be stripped of his world record in the 100-meter dash and it \\nshould be awarded to Carl Lewis, many U.S. track and field officials and \\nathletes said Wednesday in the aftermath of Johnson admitting to his steroid \\nuse. \\n\\nJohnson testified this week at a Canadian inquiry that his seven-year \\ninvolvement with illegal performance-enhancing drugs included injections before \\nthe 1987 World Championships in Rome, where he set the existing world record of \\n9.83 seconds. \\n\\n\"I would have to see the evidence, but if he was on drugs at the time of the \\nWorld Championships, my thought would be to remove his record,\" said Ollan \\nCassell, executive director of The Athletics Congress, the national governing \\nboard for the sport. \\n\\nCassell is also a vice president of the International Amateur Athletic \\nFederation, the world governing organization. \\n\\nThe possibility that Johnson could lose his record was raised when the IAAF \\nasked for \"an urgent legal opinion\" to see what it could do about records and \\nchampionships of confessed drug users. \\n\\nThe issue would be decided at the IAAF Congress, scheduled for Barcelona, \\nSpain, in September. \\n\\n\"The . . . actions would allow the IAAF, if it so decided, retroactively to \\nwithdraw results obtained and any records achieved by such athletes,\" the \\nstatement said. \\n\\nIt was not clear, however, whether any action taken by the congress would \\naffect Johnson\\'s world mark because effective dates of retroactive sanctions \\nwould have to be worked out. \\n\\nFrank Greenberg, TAC president, said: \"We\\'ll wait to see what Canada does,\" \\nfollowing the country\\'s inquiry at which 40 persons, among them Johnson, his \\ncoach, Charlie Francis, and his physician, Jamie Astaphan, testified. \\n\\n\"I feel we will do our best to advocate that our athlete, Carl Lewis, gets the \\nworld record,\" Greenberg said. \\n\\nLewis has the second-fastest legal time in history, 9.92, in finishing second \\nto Johnson at last year\\'s Seoul Olympics. Johnson, who clocked 9.79 in that \\nrace, lost the record and his gold medal, and was barred from competition for \\ntwo years after testing positive for an anabolic steroid. \\n\\nThere was much discussion among athletes competing this week in the TAC \\nChampionships about whether Johnson should be allowed back into the sport after \\nhe completes his two-year suspension. \\n\\nLewis thinks he should. \\n\\n\"He went a long time without telling the truth, but he broke down and he has \\ntold the truth,\" said Lewis, a six-time Olympic gold medalist. \"He is giving us \\nan opportunity to believe him, to support him. \\n\\n\"I even heard him speaking out against drugs and that\\'s the important thing.\" \\n\\nAl Joyner, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist in the triple jump, said Johnson \\nshould be allowed to compete again, only because that is the rule. \\n\\n\"But all his records should be taken because he admitted it,\" Joyner added. \\n\\n\"He killed a lot of fans . . . a lot of young kids . . . and he almost killed \\nour sport . . . he put a dark shadow over it . . . because of who he was,\" \\nJoyner said. \\n\\nSprinter Harvey Glance, a three-time Olympian and president of TAC\\'s Athletes \\nAdvisory Committee, said Johnson should be allowed to return after two years. \\n\\n\"But if he admits he was on anything (when he set the record), then it should \\ngo to the next person, Carl Lewis,\" Glance said. \\n\\n\"Only the records will show it and only Ben knows.\" \\n\\nJohnson was tested after his world-record run in Rome, but the results were \\nnegative. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAs of 1990, about 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are being reported annually, resulting in 1,700 deaths. Blacks are six times more likely to have tuberculosis than are whites. The disparity has long been attributed to crowded housing and other conditions of poverty. A recently published study concluded that blacks are innately more susceptible to the disease, and that when living conditions were comparable blacks were only twice as likely to contract the disease. Specialists in the area were intrigued and impressed by the study, but not all were willing to agree that biology, and not social factors, was the major factor.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis\\nthan whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic\\nsusceptibility to the disease, according to a study today.\\n   The research found that when living conditions are identical,\\nblack people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the\\nTB bacteria.\\n   The relatively high rate of TB among blacks has traditionally\\nbeen blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty.\\nWhile social factors undoubtedly play a central role, the study\\nsuggests that innate susceptibility also contributes.\\n   ``We found that there is a systemic difference between whites\\nand blacks,\\'\\' said Dr. William W. Stead. ``Whites seem to be more\\nable to fend off the organism without it\\'s ever being able to\\nestablish an infection.\\'\\'\\n   Stead, a tuberculosis specialist at the Arkansas Department of\\nHealth, discovered the racial difference while analyzing health\\nstatistics from nursing homes and prisons.\\n   ``It\\'s a very intriguing finding,\\'\\' commented Dr. George\\nComstock of Johns Hopkins University. ``I never quite believe\\nanything until somebody replicates it. But I don\\'t know of any real\\nholes in this one.\\'\\'\\n   At the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,\\nDr. George Curlin called the findings ``plausible and provocative.\\'\\'\\n   However, he added: ``I\\'m scared to death that people are going\\nto say this explains it all and forget everything else. Of the\\ntotal six times difference, what proportion is attributable to\\nbiology and what to social factors? I would say that biology is\\nrelatively minor.\\'\\'\\n   Stead\\'s study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,\\nwas based largely on a review of 25,398 elderly people who were\\nfree of TB infection when they were admitted to Arkansas nursing\\nhomes. When they were retested at least two months later, 14\\npercent of blacks and 7 percent of whites showed evidence of new\\ninfections.\\n   Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that black\\ninmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the\\nbacteria while incarcerated.\\n   Another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a\\nracial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB\\nbacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone\\nto tuberculosis.\\n   About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the\\nUnited States, resulting in 1,700 deaths. In the population at\\nlarge, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as\\nwhites.\\n   An estimated 10 million Americans are believed to be infected\\nwith the bacteria but not sick. The disease, which attacks the\\nlungs, has long been associated with poor, crowded living\\nconditions.\\n   Stead\\'s study found that blacks got infected more readily than\\nwhites, regardless of the race of the person who initially brought\\nthe infection into the nursing home. In homes where the initial\\nsource of the disease was white, 17 percent of blacks and 12\\npercent of whites caught the infection. When the primary source was\\nblack, 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted the\\nbacteria.\\n   This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected\\nwhites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.\\n   Stead speculated that whites have evolved better defenses\\nagainst TB, because the bacteria has long been common in Europe and\\nparts of Africa north of the Sahara, but is traditionally rare in\\nsub-Saharan Africa.\\n   By contrast, blacks are genetically more resistant than whites\\nto malaria, which is common in Africa.\\n   In the other study, Dr. Alfred Crowle of Webb-Waring Lung\\nInstitute at the University of Colorado found differences in the\\nresistance of germ-eating blood cells called macrophages. In\\nblacks, these cells are more likely to harbor TB infections.\\n   ``This helps explain why black people are more susceptible to\\ntuberculosis than are white people,\\'\\' said Crowle.\\n   At the turn of the century, TB was the nation\\'s leading cause of\\ndeath. The number of cases fell steadily in recent decades until\\n1984.\\n   Experts believe the decline has leveled off in part because of\\nthe emergence of the AIDS virus, which weaken the body\\'s resistance\\nto TB bacteria. Others possible factors include homelessness and\\nimmigration of people from areas where the disease is still common.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAs the date of his confirmation hearings approach, Clarence Thomas\\' life and record are being examined, and even his close friends have trouble explaining why Thomas has become a minority within a minority. In his college years Thomas shared the liberal views of many bright young blacks born into a segregated America after the 1964 Civil Rights Act erased the overt signs of segregation. As an undergraduate at Holy Cross, he marched in protests but he became more conservative as he studied law at Yale. After Yale he worked for a Republican State Attorney General, and by then he was expressing conservative viewpoints.\\nIntroduction:\\nAmong the 29 million Americans who voted for Democrat George McGovern in 1972\\nwas a 24-year-old black law student and one-time campus agitator named\\nClarence Thomas.\\nAs Thomas later explained, being Republican was regarded\\nas \"a fate . . . worse than death among blacks.\"  \\n\\nYet in a matter of weeks, Thomas goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee\\nas President Bush\\'s nominee to join the increasingly conservative Supreme\\nCourt.\\nThomas\\' dramatic political and philosophical transformation reveals\\nmore about the man than does his Horatio Alger journey from rural Southern\\npoverty to Supreme Court nomination.

It has written-off as uncollectible loans to Third World countries. The Bank of Boston, a regional bank, has an advantage over money- centered banks like those in New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Bank of Boston has a large loan-loss reserve that the large banks lack. The inhibiting factor for regional banks is once you have been burned by the need to write-off a loan, you are much less likely to join any new such effort. Other regional banks may follow Bank of Boston\\'s lead.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nBank of Boston Corp.\\'s decision to treat its Third World loans much more conservatively is expected to have significant domestic and international repercussions, bankers and analysts say. \\n\\n\\nDomestically, the move reflects the competitive advantage that regional banks with large loan-loss reserves have over their big brothers in such money centers as New York, Chicago and San Francisco. \\nInternationally, it appears that it will be even more difficult for economically troubled developing nations to attract new bank loans. \\n\\n\\nU.S. banks are increasingly splitting into two groups. \\nOn one hand, there is a small group of money-center banks with comparatively thin reserves against large loans to developing countries. \\nOn the other hand is a group of regional institutions which, with relatively small exposure to developing countries, are willing to establish big reserves against such loans or, as Bank of Boston decided Monday, to completely write off some loans as uncollectible. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a parting of the ways between the money centers who are out to collect on their assets and the regionals who want to get out,\" says Lawrence Cohn, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. \\n\\n\\nThe Bank of Boston decision \"may well drive a wedge between the money-center banks and the regional banks,\" adds James J. McDermott, Jr., director of research at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., a securities firm which specializes in bank stocks. \\n\"It\\'s created an enormous quandary for many money-center banks,\" Mr. McDermott says. \\n\\n\\nActions such as that taken by Bank of Boston highlight a potential competitive edge that regional banks have over money-center banks. \\nManagement could use their reserve position to emphasize stength when competing for deposits and banking business against larger banks. \\nThe reserve action also could make it easier for institutions like Bank of Boston to attract investors to their stock and other securities, bank analysts said. \\n\\n\\nWhile the large banks are eager to remain competitive with such regionals as Bank of Boston, they also want to ensure that the regionals continue to lend to heavily indebted developing nations. \\nEarlier this year, Bank of Boston proved one of the more difficult regionals to corral into a $6 billion bank loan for Mexico, according to New York bankers. \\nNow that Bank of Boston has reserved and written off most of its loans to less-developed countries, it\\'s likely to be much less willing to join any such new efforts. \\nThat could add to the lending burden for the biggest U.S. banks. \\n\\n\\nMoreover, most of the nation\\'s big banks couldn\\'t afford to follow Bank of Boston\\'s lead without crippling their capital, and reducing their common equity-asset ratios to unacceptably low levels. \\nFor instance, if Manufacturers Hanover Corp. imitated Bank of Boston\\'s action, it would have to add $3.13 billion to reserves and would have a common assets ratio of only 0.69%, Keefe Bruyette estimates. \\n\\n\\nIn order to take steps similar to Bank of Boston\\'s, large money-center banks would have to sell assets, shrink balance sheets and slash dividends -- and they show little sign of doing that. \\nYesterday, Manufacturers Hanover announced a regular quarterly dividend of 82 cents a share, offering investors a yield of more than 13% annually. \\n\\n\\nManufacturers Hanover declined to comment on whether it might follow Bank of Boston\\'s action. \\nOther large New York banks also declined to disclose their plans, although a spokeman for Chase Manhattan Corp., said, \"We\\'re obviously looking at it.\" \\n\\n\\nMellon Bank Corp. said yesterday that it expects a fourth-quarter loss of about $220 million, and that it would increase loan-loss reserves by about $180 million to cover troubled foreign loans. \\n\\n\\nThe stocks of several major money-center banks fell sharply yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. \\nChase Manhattan skidded $2.25 to close at $20.125, Manufacturers Hanover fell $2.375 to $24.25, and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. was off $1.50 to $30. \\nBank of Boston closed up 50 cents at $20.75, while Mellon fell $1 to $26.25. \\n\\n\\nAnalysts expect that other regional banks may copy the action taken by Bank of Boston. \\n\"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if some of the medium-sized regionals decided to follow,\" said Cheryl Swaim, an analyst and vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. \\nIn Boston, there were rumors Bank of New England might announce a similar move, but a company spokesman said \"reserve levels are appropriate.\" \\n\\n\\nBank of Boston announced Monday that it was writing off $200 million of loans to less-developed countries and that it was placing all but a small portion of its loans to the Third World on a non-accrual basis. \\n\\n\\nWhen a loan is placed on non-accrual, a bank only credits interest it actually receives, and doesn\\'t automatically accrue interest due. \\n\\n\\nBank of Boston also placed on non-accrual $470 million in loans to less-developed countries that are unrelated to trade. \\nAlong with $330 million in such loans previously put on non-accrual, Bank of Boston has now either charged off, or put on non-accrual, all of its $1 billion loans to heavily indebted developing countries. \\nThis doesn\\'t include $170 million in trade-related debt. \\n\\n\\nWhile Bank of Boston\\'s action is the most striking to date to remove Latin exposure from its balance sheet, smaller similar actions began at other banks around mid-year. \\n\\n\\nFirst Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, the nation\\'s 15th biggest banking concern, charged off $25.4 million in troubled foreign loans during the third quarter. \\nFirst Chicago Corp., the 11th largest banking concern, charged off $48.9 million in Third World loans during the quarter. \\n\\n\\nAnd even before the big reserves were set aside, banks were quietly charging off Latin debt, though on a smaller scale. \\nLast March, Continental Illinois Corp. said it had charged off about half of its $100 million of loans to Peru. \\nContinental wouldn\\'t comment yesterday on Bank of Boston\\'s action. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nIn terms of magnitude, Chile is the world\\'s most seismic country. It has a coastline of 2,270 miles along the \"ring of fire,\" between the Nacza and South American plates. A 1985, 7.1 Richter Scale earthquake was comparable to the San Francisco quake. But a 1960 quake of 9.5 destroyed Valparaiso. Parts of the coast dropped nine feet and 5,000 people were killed. A tsunami followed, killing others. Chilean engineers design their buildings of reinforced concrete. They do not rock during earthquakes, and since these codes were adopted in 1930, only three engineered buildings have collapsed.\\nIntroduction:\\nScientists and engineers in Chile, which has the distinction of playing host to \\nthe largest earthquake ever measured, are waiting with serious interest reports \\non the Oct. 17 San Francisco earthquake. \\n\\nMeasured by magnitude, \"Chile is the world\\'s most seismic country,\" said \\nbuilding engineer Elias Arze, president of the Chilean Seismology and \\nAnti-Seismic Engineering Assn. \\n\\nThe San Francisco quake measuring 7.1 was comparable to the earthquake that \\nstruck Santiago and central Chile in March, 1985, killing 180 people and \\ntoppling some 70,000 homes. \\n\\nAnd like California, Chile is still waiting for another \"big one,\" an \\nearthquake of magnitude 8 or more. Both areas are situated along the Pacific \\n\"ring of fire,\" the huge faults created by the collision of massive plates of \\nthe earth\\'s surface. \\n\\n\"Chile, along with Alaska, are the sites that have had the biggest seismic \\noccurrences,\" said Prof. Edgar Kausel, chairman of the Geophysics Department at \\nthe University of Chile. \\n\\nChile has about 2,270 miles of its coast along the earthquake fault between the \\nNazca plate and the South American plate. The frequency of earth movements \\nprompts Chileans to say that every president has at least one major earthquake \\nduring the traditional six-year term in office. \\n\\nThe long history of earth movements in Chile has led to a sharing of \\ninformation with U.S. and Japanese scientists and engineers over the behavior \\nof the earth and of buildings during earthquakes. \\n\\nArze said after the 1985 earthquake, teams of foreign experts arrived in Chile \\nto study the effects of the earthquake on buildings. \\n\\n\"Our buildings performed very well,\" he said. \\n\\nSince earthquake building codes were implemented in Chile in the 1930s, only \\ntwo engineered buildings have collapsed, he said. Older buildings have been \\nreplaced over the years. \\n\\n\"We have so many earthquakes in Chile it has cleaned up our construction,\" Arze \\nsaid. \\n\\nChilean earthquakes tend to be sharper and last longer than those of \\nCalifornia, leading to differences in building design. \\n\\nWhile California engineers have promoted a flexible design of steel framed \\nbuildings that allows them to swing in a quake, Chileans opt for stiffer \\nconstruction. Chilean buildings are of reinforced concrete with more inside \\nwalls. \\n\\n\"Our buildings move little compared to (those of) the Americans,\" said Arze. \\n\\nDescriptions of earthquakes in Chile date back to Spanish settlers in 1575. \\n\\nIn an 1835 journal entry about a stop the ship the Beagle made in Chile, \\nscientist Charles Darwin described an earthquake he experienced. \\n\\nJust a few months before the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco, a quake \\nmeasuring 8.5 struck the central Chilean coast, destroying the city of \\nValparaiso. \\n\\nOn May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles \\nlong in southern Chile, releasing energy nearly 1,000 times that of this year\\'s \\nSan Francisco quake. Parts of the coast stretching south from the city of \\nConcepcion, 325 miles south of Santiago, dropped nine feet. \\n\\n\"It was the biggest registered in the history of seismic instrumention,\" said \\nKausel. \\n\\nAbout 5,000 people were killed in the sparsely populated area, most of them \\nwhen the coastline dropped. A tsunami, a tidal wave created by the earthquake, \\nkilled others and caused considerable damage in Japan and Hawaii. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nBritain risks failing to take full advantage of the cross-channel \"Chunnel\" due to the Thatcher government\\'s announcement yesterday that it would not help fund a high-speed rail line between London and the tunnel.

The lack of the high-speed rail link, and improved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the tunnel\\'s total benefits. The consortium formed to build the link asked the government for a financial contribution, which the government says involves \"unacceptable\" risks to the taxpayer.

The Thatcher government\\'s announcement\\nyesterday that it wouldn\\'t help fund a high-speed rail link\\nbetween London and the tunnel has fueled fears that the\\ncountry\\'s creaky transportation system will isolate Britain\\non the periphery of Europe.\\n\\nSarah Talbot-Williams, a spokeswoman for the Confederation\\nof British Industry, Britain\\'s main employers\\' group says,\\n\"1992 is going to produce a much more competitive market. \"If\\nwe don\\'t have the infrastructure to get the goods to Europe,\\nwe\\'ll continue our status as an island.\"\\n\\nLong plagued by soaring costs and drilling delays, the\\ntunnel now looks set to open on time in June 1993. British\\ndiggers, who once lagged months behind schedule, currently\\nare just one week behind; their French counterparts are\\nrunning three months ahead of plan. And although the\\nproject\\'s estimated cost has soared to #7.66 billion ($13.11\\nbillion) from #4.9 billion, tunnel executives have obtained\\nunderwriting for an equity rights offer and preliminary\\nagreement for more bank loans to cover the added cost.\\n\\n\"There will be no more talk of crisis,\" says Alastair\\nMorton, chief executive officer of Eurotunnel PLC, the\\nconsortium building the cross-channel link. \"The money will\\nbe together this year, and the project will be clear from\\nthere.\"\\n\\nBut the lack of a high-speed rail link to London, and\\nimproved service beyond, means Britain may miss out on the\\ntunnel\\'s total benefits. \"There is a danger of not being able\\nto exploit the tunnel to its full potential,\" says Prof.\\nChristopher Nash, a transport expert at Leeds University in\\nNorthern England.\\n\\nThe government\\'s refusal to help fund a fast rail service\\nbetween London and the tunnel terminal at Folkestone\\nculminates an 18-month squabble. European Rail Link Ltd., a\\nconsortium formed last November to build the rail link, had\\nasked the government to contribute #350 million towards the\\ntotal #2.6 billion cost of the link.\\n\\nTransport Secretary Cecil Parkinson told the House of\\nCommons that the consortium\\'s plans involved \"unacceptable\"\\nrisks for taxpayers. He said British Rail, which owns 50% of\\nthe consortium, would consider other options for a fast-rail\\nlink. But no one expects a viable scheme anytime soon.\\n\\nDefending the decision, Mrs. Thatcher earlier told\\nParliament that the government already had earmarked almost\\n#2 billion for chunnel-related projects, including #600\\nmillion on roads leading to the tunnel and #1.3 billion in\\npassenger and freight rail services.\\n\\nBut that didn\\'t satisfy opposition legislators. \"Britain\\nwill enter the 21st century with an inadequate 19th-century\\nrailway link,\" said John Prescott, the Labour Party\\'s\\ntransportation spokesman.\\n\\nAs a result of Thursday\\'s decision, the journey time to\\nLondon from Paris will be about three hours -- 30 minutes\\nlonger than with a high-speed rail link. Passengers boarding\\nhigh-speed trains in Paris will zoom at 180 miles an hour\\nnorth to Calais, slow to 100 miles an hour through the\\ntunnel, then crawl at an average of 60 miles an hour across\\nsoutheast England\\'s crowded commuter belt.\\n\\n\"The traffic will now speed through as far as our side of\\nthe tunnel, and then the men with red flags will lead it on\\nto London,\" complains Keith Speed, a Conservative member of\\nParliament whose constituency is near the tunnel terminal.\\n\\nEurotunnel insists the tunnel will be financially viable\\nwithout the high-speed rail link. The tunnel-building\\nconsortium argues that only 39% of its total revenue will\\ncome from direct London-to-Paris trains; the real\\nmoney-spinner will be freight traffic hauled by road to the\\ntunnel, then loaded onto special Eurotunnel wagons for the\\njourney under the channel.\\n\\n\"We make more money on road traffic using our tunnel,\" Mr.\\nMorton says. \"There is in no sense a feeling we must have\\nthat link to make the tunnel successful.\"\\n\\nBut Mr. Morton admits he wants to see the high-speed link\\nbuilt, professing it would divert traffic from southeast\\nEngland\\'s clogged roads. The high-speed link \"will be a\\nbenefit for us,\" he says, \"but essential for the country.\"\\n\\nSome analysts go further, arguing the tunnel indeed needs\\nbetter rail links if it is to compete with improving ferry\\nand air services. \"A high-speed link which covers {only} part\\nof the route proves to be fairly uncompetitive with other\\ntransportation modes,\" says Bill Steinmetz, vice president of\\ntransport for consultants Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. in\\nLondon. \"If you\\'re going to build high-speed rail, you have\\nto decide how to provide complete links. It\\'s like having\\npart of a house built. It may function, but you do worry\\nabout it.\"\\n\\nThe worries don\\'t end in London.

The bill requires a five-day waiting period before the purchase of a handgun. The Brady Bill, the recent ban on the purchase of assault weapons, and other pending bills are being viewed by some anti-gun proponents as an indication that the tide has turned in favor of gun control. Opponents of gun control, led by the National Rifle Association and citing their authority as the Second Amendment to the Constitution, continue their opposition to all forms of gun control.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe smoke has cleared a little. After seven long years, the US Congress this\\nweek passed its first significant gun control law since the assassinations\\nof Mr Robert Kennedy and Rev Martin Luther King Jr in 1968.\\nThe legislation - known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady, the former\\nWhite House press secretary severely wounded in an assassination attempt on\\nPresident Ronald Reagan - would impose a five-day waiting period on\\npurchases of handguns. It would give law enforcement authorities time to\\ncheck the buyer\\'s background.\\nAdvocates of tougher controls on guns were jubilant about their victory over\\nstubborn resistance by Republican senators from western states such as Idaho\\nand Alaska, who have long opposed any restriction on gun ownership in the\\nUS.\\nThe Brady bill\\'s opponents in Congress say it will inconvenience only\\nlaw-abiding citizens, not criminals who buy or steal their weapons away from\\nthe government\\'s prying eyes.\\nThey point to glaring failings in the federal government\\'s policing of the\\n276,000 licensed gun dealers in the US as evidence of the Brady bill\\'s\\nlikely ineffectiveness. For instance, one newspaper reporter successfully\\nobtained a dealer\\'s licence for his dog by submitting a made-up social\\nsecurity number.\\nStudies of state laws requiring some form of background check suggest,\\nhowever, that at least some sales to convicted felons have been stopped, and\\nsome suspected criminals have been caught when they tried to buy a gun.\\nBut even the most ardent supporters of the Brady bill acknowledge that it\\nwill make no more than a dent in the estimated 7.5m legal sales each year of\\nnew or used firearms, let alone the approximately 200m guns in circulation;\\nand will barely affect the more than 14,000 murders and 1,400 accidental\\ndeaths involving guns each year.\\n\\'The longest journey begins with a single step,\\' Mr Brady said after the\\nbill\\'s final passage in the Senate on Wednesday.\\nDespite its uncertain effect, passage of the Brady bill is read by some as a\\nsign that the tide has turned decisively in favour of gun control. Other\\ninitiatives in Congress and in state legislatures are under way: the Senate\\nlast week agreed in a separate bill to ban assault weapons, a measure\\nalready in force in California, New Jersey and Connecticut. Virginia has\\npassed a law restricting people to one gun purchase a month.\\nWith the federal government considering the imposition of punitive taxes on\\nsome particularly devastating types of ammunition, the Winchester company\\nrecently decided to withdraw its Black Talon bullet. This is prized by some\\ngame hunters for its killing power but detested by emergency room doctors\\nfor the damage it inflicts on humans as it mushrooms on impact.\\nThe strength of public feeling about rampant gun use has clearly grown in\\nthe face of an apparently unstoppable wave of urban violence that has\\nbrought the rate of death by shooting among young black men to more than 150\\nper 100,000, and led to the installation of metal detectors in city schools.\\nThe fear of violent crimes such as carjackings and drive-by shootings has\\nspread even beyond the inner city and into the suburbs and the countryside,\\nprovoking a widespread feeling that something - anything - must be done.\\nThe message from an outraged public is not, however, unequivocally in favour\\nof gun control.\\nParadoxically, while thousands of people have been telephoning their\\nRepublican senators to demand that they stop blocking the Brady bill,\\nthousands have also been flocking to join the National Rifle Association,\\nthe leading organisation among the pro-gun lobbies. In the past year and a\\nhalf, it has gained 1,000 members a day to bring its total, which had\\ndeclined to about 2.6m in 1991, to a record of about 3.3m. Many new members\\nand gun owners are women.\\nRecent election results have shown, too, that simply being tough on guns is\\nnot enough to woo the voters. Although Democratic Governor Jim Florio of New\\nJersey came close to victory in the gubernatorial race this month by\\nstriking a tougher stance on both guns and crime in general than his\\nRepublican challenger, Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, this was not enough.\\nVoters were swayed by economic considerations and particularly by his\\nfirst-term tax increase.\\nIn Virginia, meanwhile, Ms Mary Sue Terry, the Democratic candidate for\\ngovernor, relied in her campaign on gun control and was thrashed by Mr\\nGeorge Allen, her Republican opponent, who did not favour tighter curbs but\\npromised to be tough on criminals by abolishing parole.\\nWhile such results do not indicate that the NRA has been routed, they have\\nput the association on the defensive. Most members now favour some form of\\ngun control, but the core membership opposes all restraints on the sale of\\nfirearms. Their beliefs are rooted in an almost theological  - some would\\nsay fanatical - interpretation of the second amendment to the US\\nconstitution, which states that: \\'A well-regulated militia, being necessary\\nto the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear\\narms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\'The second amendment is not about duck-hunting. In the 1990s, it is about\\nself-defence,\\' says Mr James Jay Baker, the NRA\\'s chief Washington lobbyist.\\nTo many members, the right to self-defence is not just against muggers or\\nburglars, but against a tyrannical government. Mr Neal Knox, sacked from a\\nlobbying position with the NRA in the 1980s but now one of its elected\\ndirectors, argues that the second amendment is the citizen\\'s \\'freedom\\ninsurance plan\\' against tyranny.\\nMr Knox says the Holocaust would not have happened if Europe\\'s Jews had\\nowned rifles, and if the Nazis had not been able to confiscate guns, thanks\\nto gun registration laws passed in the 1930s. He also contends that the\\nsolution to Somalia\\'s problems is to arm Somali mothers with AK-47s.\\nSuch beliefs have led the NRA to campaign against restrictions on machine\\nguns, assault weapons and armour-piercing bullets. In the process they have\\nlost touch with many of their members, who back gun control in general and\\nspecifically the Brady bill.\\nTwo trends over the past few years have weakened the advocates of gun\\nrights. First, left-wing Democrats have begun to champion gun control as a\\nsupplement to tough anti-crime measures, rather than an alternative; they\\nhave recaptured much of the \\'tough on crime\\' high ground by backing boot\\ncamps for young delinquents, harsher sentences and stiffer restrictions on\\nparole or habeas corpus appeals.\\nThe NRA is trying to fight back with a campaign called CrimeStrike, calling\\nfor harsher measures against criminals.\\nSecond, the NRA\\'s insistence on combating any gun control, even that viewed\\nas reasonable by a majority not just of the US population but of gun-owners,\\nhas driven away some former political and police supporters.\\nSenator Denis DeConcini of Arizona, once voted the NRA\\'s \\'legislator of the\\nmonth\\', is backing a ban on assault weapons. Delegate Clinton Miller of the\\nVirginia state assembly, once rated \\'A+\\' by the NRA, now calls the\\norganisation\\'s top members \\'hateful, spiteful, arrogant\\'.\\nThis alienation is apparent among gun-owners at large. According to a Gallup\\npoll earlier this year, 57 per cent of people who said they had a gun in\\ntheir house also favoured stricter laws on the sale of firearms.\\nThese converts to gun control, however, are a long way from believing that\\nthe answer to violent crime lies in more radical action, such as the\\nproposal of Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, for a complete\\nban on handguns.\\nSome Americans may move in this direction, but many more may put their faith\\nin self-defence and buy their own weapons.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nWhen President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to become the second black to serve on the Supreme Court, he named a man whose views are at the opposite end of the spectrum from those of Thurgood Marshall, the man he would succeed. Thomas was only five years old when Marshall, the first black to serve, was appointed to the court. Marshall helped to create the world in which Thomas grew up. Thomas opposes affirmative action and quotas, and his views on other issues dear to liberals are largely unknown. Some Democrats have said they will be diligent in drawing out Thomas\\' views on controversial issues.\\nIntroduction:\\nPresident Bush on Monday nominated Clarence Thomas, a conservative Republican\\nwith a controversial record on civil rights, to replace retiring Justice\\nThurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court.\\nIf confirmed, the 43-year-old\\njudge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia would follow\\nMarshall as the second black to ascend to the court.  \\n\\nBut Thomas, who has risen in Republican ranks as an advocate of bootstrap\\nconservatism, would present a striking change from Marshall, a civil-rights\\npioneer and an anchor of the court\\'s declining liberal faction.\\nThomas,\\nbarely half the age of the man whose seat he was named to fill, came of age in\\nthe world that Marshall helped create.\\nNow the question is to what extent\\nThomas would add weight to the court\\'s new majority that appears willing to\\ndismantle important parts of the legacy that Marshall helped to build.\\nWhile not much is known about Thomas\\' views on most issues likely to come\\nbefore the court, he has made clear his opposition to affirmative action and\\nto policies that can be viewed as incorporating quotas or racial preferences.\\n   Opposes affirmative action\\nIn his year as a federal appeals court judge,\\nhe has not ruled on affirmative action, but he has long been outspoken in\\ntaking the position that government affirmative-action programs are not only\\nunwise but unconstitutional.\\nHowever, in other respects, this nomination\\nis very much a wild card both for conservatives who jumped instantly to\\nembrace it and for liberals whose responses ranged from cautious to hostile.\\n  His views on other major issues before the court, including abortion,\\nchurch-state relations and the definition of constitutional due process, are\\nunknown. Those views may well remain unknown through a confirmation process\\nthat may be contentious but that in the end is not likely to derail the\\nnomination.\\nStudied for priesthood\\nThomas attended Roman Catholic\\nschools through college and studied for the priesthood. Although the Catholic\\nChurch vigorously opposes abortion, Thomas has apparently never taken a public\\nposition on abortion or on the dimensions of the constitutional right to\\nprivacy, on which the right to abortion was based.\\nHis position on\\naffirmative action is probably sufficient to shift the court\\'s direction since\\nthe court remains closely divided.\\n\"My opposition to preferences and\\nquotas not only is a constitutional, legal opposition, it has been a moral,\\nethical opposition,\" he said five years ago at a conference sponsored by the\\nAnti-Defamation League of B\\'nai B\\'rith.\\nIn its most recent\\naffirmative-action decision, a year ago, the court split 5-4 in upholding a\\nFederal Communications Commission policy that gives preference to blacks and\\nmembers of other minorities in acquiring some radio and television licenses.\\n  Justice William Brennan wrote that decision a few weeks before he retired\\nfrom the court. Marshall joined it. The views of Justice David Souter,\\nBrennan\\'s successor, remain largely unknown.\\nViews on big issues unknown; \\nThomas\\' views on the other major issues remain unknown, although the 1990\\nconfirmation hearing for his seat on the Court of Appeals was widely viewed on\\nCapitol Hill and in ideological interest groups as a rehearsal for a Supreme\\nCourt nomination.\\nSome Democratic senators said at the time and again\\nMonday that their votes to confirm him for the appeals court should not be\\ntaken as endorsements for the Supreme Court.\\nThree years ago, the Senate\\ndenied confirmation to Judge Robert Bork despite having voted to confirm him\\nonly a few years earlier to the same court on which Thomas now sits.\\nLeaders of abortion rights groups said Monday that they would press the Senate\\nto deny confirmation to Thomas unless he expresses his support for the Supreme\\nCourt\\'s abortion precedents, including continued adherence to Roe vs. Wade,\\nthe 1973 ruling that established the constitutional right to abortion.\\nAbortion faction speaks out\\n\"The Souter model of silence and evasion that we\\nsaw last year is absolutely unacceptable,\" said Kate Michelman, executive\\ndirector of the National Abortion Rights Action League.\\nHer reference was\\nto Souter\\'s confirmation hearing last September, during which the nominee\\ngracefully but firmly deflected questions on abortion.\\nSen.

He spotted a man making a phone call and, according to the suspect, grabbed his shoulder, spun him around and asked him to identify himself. Then Searle grabbed the suspect by the neck, they fell to the floor, the officer put a knee on the suspect\\'s back, and handcuffed him. The suspect was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman. Morgan is suing in federal court claiming that he suffered this treatment because he is black and fit a certain \"profile\" used by narcotics officers.\\nIntroduction:\\nAs they scanned the flow of passengers at Los Angeles International Airport, \\npolice detective Clayton Searle and his fellow narcotics officer searched for \\nthe likely companion of the suspected drug courier who stood handcuffed nearby. \\n\\nWhen Searle noticed a short, muscular black man walk toward them and then turn \\nabruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes Los Angeles police \\ndetective moved in quickly to question him. \\n\\nWithin minutes, however, their words had turned into violence, and the two men \\ntoppled to the terminal floor where Searle handcuffed his suspect and pulled \\nhim to his feet. Placing his hand across the man\\'s mouth, the officer then \\nmarched him away before a gathering crowd of gaping passersby. \\n\\nOnly later did Searle and his partner from the Drug Enforcement Administration \\nrealize that the suspected drug courier they had arrested on that March day in \\n1988 was Joe Morgan, the former Cincinnati Reds second baseman who was inducted \\nMonday into Major League baseball\\'s Hall of Fame. \\n\\nThe 46-year-old Morgan, who is now an Oakland businessman and baseball \\nbroadcaster, is suing Searle and the city of Los Angeles in federal court, \\nclaiming that he was unfairly targeted because he is black and fit a certain \\n\"profile\" that narcotics officers think a drug courier should look like. \\n\\n\"There\\'s no doubt in our mind that the only reason they stopped Joe Morgan was \\nbecause he is black and he was the first black who happened to come by,\" said \\nWilliam Barnes, one of the attorneys representing the former ballplayer. \\n\\nThe Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug \\ncourier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports. \\n\\n\"It\\'s purely based on race or dress, not on whether you are involved in any \\ndrug activity,\" said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police \\nofficer who specializes in such cases. \\n\\nFirst developed in the 1970s, the drug courier profile was based on patterns of \\nbehavior believed to be used by those who use commercial airline flights to \\ntransport narcotics. Such suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying \\nfor tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage \\nand staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics. \\n\\nLast year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that government agents may stop and \\nquestion airline passengers who look and act like drug couriers. But the court \\nsaid brief detentions must be based on a person\\'s behavior, not just on race or \\nappearance. \\n\\n\"Profiles are important and we use them, but exactly how we use them or what \\nthe profile is I cannot tell you,\" said Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. \\nWilliam Booth. \"It is certainly not something based on any prejudice or racism. \\nIt\\'s based on trying to protect the public.\" He said that last year, 254 \\nnarcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport. Through Aug. \\n3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests. \\n\\nFrank Schults, chief of public affairs for the DEA in Washington, denied that \\nhis agency uses drug courier profiles. \\n\\n\"We have any number of investigative techniques and ways to identify people \\ninvolved in moving drugs, but a profile is not one of them,\" he said. \\n\\nNeither Booth nor Schults would comment on the Morgan lawsuit, which is \\nscheduled to go to trial for a second time next month in Los Angeles. Morgan is \\nseeking unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated. \\n\\nLast April, a six-person federal jury rejected Morgan\\'s case. But two months \\nlater, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer set aside the verdict after \\nruling that she had failed to instruct jurors that Morgan had been illegally \\ndetained by police. \\n\\n\"There isn\\'t any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal,\" the \\njudge concluded. \\n\\nBoth Searle, a 20-year Police Department veteran, and William Woessner, a DEA \\nagent who was subsequently dropped from the lawsuit, have denied that they did \\nanything wrong. \\n\\n\"I wish that this hadn\\'t happened,\" Searle said. \"I wish (Morgan) luck now that \\nI know who he is. I just hope I never see him again.\" \\n\\nMorgan could not be reached for comment. But in court documents, he said that \\non March 15, 1988, he was waiting at Los Angeles International Airport for a \\nconnecting flight to Tucson to attend a golf tournament and was innocently \\nmaking a phone call when Searle suddenly grabbed his shoulder and spun him \\naround. \\n\\nAsked to identify himself, Morgan said he told the officer that his wallet was \\nin an attache case about 40 feet away but that Searle refused to let him \\nretrieve it. When a bystander -- who would later testify for Morgan -- \\nrecognized the former player and tried to intervene, both men claimed that \\nSearle warned the man to stay away. \\n\\nMinutes later, Morgan said, Searle grabbed him by the neck and they fell to the \\nfloor. Morgan said the officer then put a knee in his back, wrenched his arms \\nbehind him and handcuffed him. \\n\\nHe was taken to a small children\\'s nursery in the terminal and interrogated, \\nbut within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, Morgan said. Searle \\nthen offered to free him if he would forget the matter, according to Morgan\\'s \\nlawsuit. Instead, Morgan filed his complaint, in part, to discourage similar \\nincidents from occurring, his attorneys said. \\n\\n\"This happened to Joe Morgan, but it really is applicable to any black person \\nwho uses Los Angeles airport,\" said Oakland attorney Edwin Wilson Jr., who also \\nis black. \"If it wasn\\'t Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to \\nany other black person.\" \\n\\nSearle, 42, denied the allegations but told The Times he could not discuss \\nspecifics of the case. \\n\\n\"All I can say is that the guy is a great baseball player and appears to be a \\ngood announcer,\" Searle said. \"I wish it didn\\'t happen. He just sort of went \\nout of control.\" \\n\\nAssistant City Atty. Honey A. Lewis, who represents the officer and the Police \\nDepartment, said Searle had acted properly and was merely asking Morgan to \\nidentify himself when Morgan suddenly became belligerent, spewing profanities \\nand slapping the officer. \\n\\n\"My argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted,\" Lewis said. \"If he had \\ncooperated, none of this would have happened. I think he had a bruised ego, and \\nhe was offended because the officer hadn\\'t recognized him.\" \\n\\nAccording to Searle\\'s sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and \\nWoessner, working together as members of an airport anti-drug task force, had \\narrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier. They said he was using an \\nalias. \\n\\nAlthough the officers found no drugs in his possession, Searle said they \\ndiscovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began \\nlooking for his companion. Since the passenger was black and indicated that his \\ncompanion \"looked like me,\" the officer began looking for a black man who was \\nnervous-looking or having \"other characteristics of a narcotics courier.\" \\n\\nWhen they spotted Morgan, Searle said, he tried to speak to him but Morgan \\nstarted screaming profanities and \"making animal noises\" and hit him in the \\nchest with a wild swing. \\n\\nIn his suit, Morgan denies that and contends that he suffered \"acute physical \\nand emotional distress and embarrassment\" after the incident and expressed \\nconcern about damage to his reputation. \\n\\nRELATED STORY: C14 \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nA number of years ago, Ethiopian athletes came out of Africa and surprised the world by winning three consecutive Olympic marathon gold medals. That domination appears to be happening again. Now, Abebe Mekonnen, an Ethiopean policeman, has won the prestigious Boston Marathon for 1989. Two other Ethiopians were in the race, finishing ninth and 18th. In two days, runners from Ethiopia have won three major world marathons. Another Ethiopian is the favorite in the upcoming London marathon. Ethiopians train in a mountainous area of their country and it is this altitude that enhances their performance.\\nIntroduction:\\nOut of the horn of Africa has emerged the most devastating and dominant group \\nof marathon runners the world has seen. \\n\\nOr at least since the last time Ethiopia ventured from its athletic isolation \\nand won three consecutive Olympic gold medals, putting its indelible stamp on \\nthe marathon. It appears to be happening again, a generation after Abebe Bikila \\nran barefoot through the darkened streets of Rome in 1960 to win the first of \\nhis two Olympic golds. \\n\\nNow it is Abebe Mekonnen, who was born the year Bikila won the 1964 Olympic \\nMarathon in Tokyo and a nation named its baby boys after its hero. \\n\\nMekonnen, a police lieutenant from Addis Ababa, made a furious rush with a mile \\nto go, passing Juma Ikangaa of Tanzania and winning Monday\\'s Boston Marathon in \\n2 hours 9 minutes 6 seconds. Ikangaa was second in 2:09:56. It was only the \\nsecond time an African has won here. \\n\\nIngrid Kristiansen of Norway easily won the women\\'s race in 2:24:33 after \\nabandoning her attempt to break 2:20. Kristiansen, the women\\'s marathon world \\nrecord-holder, started fast but slowed markedly on a hot day. With temperatures \\nin the high 60s during the Patriot\\'s Day race, it was about 20 degrees warmer \\nthan it was Sunday and all of last week. \\n\\nStill, Kristiansen finished 26th overall, believed to be the highest finish for \\na woman in this race. \\n\\nJoan Benoit Samuelson, who set a world record on this course in 1983, was beset \\nwith physical problems that altered her stride at 11 miles, and she finished \\nninth among the women in 2:37:52. It was the worst marathon performance of her \\ncareer. \\n\\nIt also was the first time Kristiansen had beaten Samuelson in a marathon. In \\nan emotional news conference afterward, Samuelson, who won the first women\\'s \\nOlympic marathon in 1984 at Los Angeles, tearfully conceded that she might have \\nrun her last marathon for some time. \\n\\nBut the story of Monday\\'s 93rd Boston race was Mekonnen and his nation of 42 \\nmillion, which has reemerged as a force to be reckoned with in marathon \\nrunning. \\n\\nIn two days, Ethiopian runners have won three major marathons. In Rotterdam on \\nSunday, Belayneh Dinsamo won in 2:08:39. Dinsamo holds the world record of \\n2:06:50, set last year on the same course. \\n\\nAlso on Sunday, in the World Cup Marathon at Milan, Ethiopians finished 1-2. \\nKeleke Metaferia won in 2:10:28, and Dereje Nedi was second in 2:10:36. \\nEthiopia beat Italy for the World Cup team title with a second-string team. \\n\\nNearly a dozen Ethiopian runners have been deployed around the world in this \\nhectic two-week period of spring marathons. Two other Ethiopians were in \\nMonday\\'s Boston race, placing ninth and 18th. And still another, Wodajo Bulti, \\nwho has run 2:08:44, is one of the favorites in the London Marathon next \\nSunday. \\n\\nEthiopia\\'s legacy to the world in the last decade has been one of drought, \\nfamine and ethnic civil war. More than 1 million people died in 1984-85 during \\na drought-caused famine. The plight of Ethiopians caught the imagination of the \\nworld and inspired rock musicians and others to organize benefit concerts. \\nBecause of internal disturbances, however, little of that aid ever reached the \\nneedy. \\n\\nPolitically pro-Soviet, Ethiopia\\'s Marxist government ordered boycotts of the \\nOlympic Games in 1976, 1984 and 1988. Had they not boycotted, at least three \\nEthiopian runners would have been among the favorites in the men\\'s marathon at \\nSeoul. \\n\\nDespite its erratic participation, however, Ethiopia has a proud Olympic \\nheritage, dating to 1956. \\n\\nOne of the marathon\\'s most enduring figures was Bikila, who won the marathon \\ngold medal in 1960 and 1964. Ethiopia also took the marathon gold in 1968, when \\nMamo Wolde, 36, won at altitude in Mexico City. \\n\\nIt is the altitude at which the Ethiopians train that enhances their aerobic \\ncapacity. Much of the central part of the country is mountainous, ranging in \\naltitude from 6,000 to 15,000 feet. \\n\\nIt was the first time since 1963 that an Ethiopian had run at Boston and \\nMekonnen, 24, made the most of it. He was among the pack of four African \\nrunners that led the 6,418 entrants race for 15 miles. At about mile 16, \\nMekonnen and Ikangaa took off, running at first side by side, then with Ikangaa \\nholding a slight lead. \\n\\nAnd they ran not as strangers, because Mekonnen had beaten Ikangaa in winning \\nlast year\\'s Tokyo Marathon. \\n\\n\"I know him very well as a runner,\" Mekonnen said through an interpreter. \"I \\nknew that I should stay with him until the last (two miles). He\\'s a good \\nrunner, but he does not have a good finish.\" \\n\\nMekonnen and Kristiansen each earned $45,000. \\n\\nJohn Treacy of Ireland, who was third behind Ikangaa here last year, was third \\nagain in 2:10:24. \\n\\n\"I knew that they had gone out very hard,\" Treacy said of the blistering early \\npace. Until the halfway point, the men were on a 2:04 pace, dangerous in \\nMonday\\'s heat. \\n\\nThe pace got the best of Saimon Robert Haali of Tanzania, who led the race for \\nfive miles. He finished sixth. \\n\\nThe women\\'s race had only one leader, Kristiansen. She, too, set an incredible \\nearly pace. For the first few miles, before the heat, Kristiansen was running \\nat a 2:17 pace. By the 17th mile, she had added more than 20 seconds to her \\nmile splits. \\n\\nBy her own reckoning, it was at almost 16 miles that Kristiansen felt the heat. \\n\\n\"I decided to just win the race,\" she said. \"It was too hot to set the world \\nrecord.\" \\n\\nSamuelson held on to second place and even ran comfortably until about 11 \\nmiles, when she came undone. \\n\\n\"I was prepared for hot weather and it certainly was hot, but the heat wasn\\'t \\nmy problem today,\" Samuelson said. \"I felt real easy the first 11 miles, I felt \\nI was right in the groove. I was right where I wanted to be. \\n\\n\"Before I came to Boston, I had a lot of problems with my hip and my back. At \\nabout 11 miles, it went very quickly. I lost my stride from that point. Lisa \\nWeidenbach went flying by me at that point. Marguerite (Buist) went shortly \\nthereafter. I kept thinking I\\'d pull it off. I didn\\'t have the day I really \\nwanted. I was duly humbled.\" \\n\\nSamuelson, who had knee surgery in February, continued to fade as her stride \\nfaltered and was beaten by three U.S. runners. It had been at least eight years \\nsince Samuelson was beaten in the marathon by an American. \\n\\nBuist, of New Zealand, was second in 2:29:04. Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash., was \\nthird in 2:29:34. Weidenbach was fifth. \\n\\n\"It\\'s always difficult to be beaten by Americans when you are the American \\nchampion,\" Kristiansen said. \"The easiest way to be beaten is to drop out of a \\nrace. And she didn\\'t. I think it\\'s great that she finished.\" \\n\\nSuch compliments did little to placate Samuelson. In the postrace news \\nconference, the private Samuelson was as emotional as she has ever been in \\npublic. Her voice broke several times. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve run some very good races and I think I have some very good races left in \\nme,\" she said. \"A lot of people are expecting me to say this is it. It\\'s not \\nit. (But) I have been spending as much time in physical therapy as I have in \\ntraining and I can\\'t continue that. I think I need to take an indefinite rest. \\nIt could be a year, it could be five years. I just can\\'t go on with my \\nresponsibilities as a wife and mother and spend this amount of time in physical \\ntherapy and training.

It hopped along a 25-mile path plowing through a school, rural areas, a shopping mall and adjacent apartments. It tossed cars and trucks on Interstate 85. It was one of a series that touched down in seven states from the Deep South to the Midwest. Later, a tornado watch was issued for the Atlantic coast and New England states. This was Alabama\\'s deadliest twister since 1975 when 22 people died in Birmingham. Officials are requesting federal disaster assistance.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Rescuers crawled through collapsed homes\\nand shops today looking for more victims of a tornado that carved a\\n3-mile stretch of destruction, killing 17 people, injuring 463 and\\nleaving 1,000 homeless.\\n   ``It\\'s like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in a\\nblender and putting it on liquefy,\\'\\' said rescue worker Bob\\nCaraway, whose specialty is cave rescues. He was among those called\\nout to help dig through rubble for survivors or the bodies of the\\ndead.\\n   The tornado was one of a series that touched down Wednesday in\\nan arc spanning at least seven states from the Deep South to the\\nMidwest. The other tornadoes caused at least 19 injuries and\\nfar-flung property damage.\\n   In Huntsville, teams with cranes and floodlights searched for\\nthe injured or dead, hampered by wind-whipped rain and temperatures\\nthat plummeted overnight from 73 degrees into the 30s.\\n   Gov. Guy Hunt sent 50 National Guardsmen to help and said he\\nwould view damage Friday. His spokesman, Terry Abbott, said aerial\\nsurveys indicate the twister hopped along a 25-mile path, much of\\nit straight through Huntsville.\\n   By this afternoon, severe thunderstorms were crossing the\\nNortheast. The National Weather Service put out a tornado watch for\\nparts of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York,\\nall of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and parts of Massachusetts,\\nVermont and New Hampshire.\\n   In Pennsylvania, the weather service said it received\\nunconfirmed reports of a tornado that turned over a car and knocked\\ndown trees and power lines near Gettysburg.\\n   Elsewhere:\\n   _In Georgia, 19 people were injured, four critically, and at\\nleast 200 people were evacuated after a tornado strus.C., and a tornado\\ntoppled trees, downed\\npower lines and damaged 20 houses near Greenwood, S.C. No injuries\\nwere reported in either state.\\n   _Tornadoes caused minor property damage in Mississippi, Kentucky\\nand Indiana.\\n   _In West Virginia, high winds believed to be tornadoes swept\\nJefferson County early today, overturning trailers, blowing roofs\\noff homes and downing power lines, authorities said. Four people\\nwere injured, two seriously.\\n   _Heavy thunderstorms destroyed at least a dozen homes in\\nAlorton, Ill., killing one person and injuring 20 others, five\\nseriously, authorities said.\\n   The tornado struck Huntsville with virtually no warning\\nWednesday afternoon as the city\\'s streets grew busy with the\\napproach of rush hour. In a matter of seconds, cars were hurled\\nthrough the air and crushed, and apartments and stores looked as if\\nthey had been bombed.\\n   ``It was fast,\\'\\' said Lucy Lee Rusk, whose apartment was\\nbattered by debris. ``It was like one big pop and that\\'s when\\neverything went.\\'\\'\\n   The National Weather Service had issued a tornado watch earlier\\nin the day, but did not issue a more urgent tornado warning until\\n4:39 p.m. CST, when the tornado was spotted at the municipal golf\\ncourse. By then, it was already tearing up the city.\\n   A watch means a tornado is considered possible, while a warning\\nmeans a tornado is believed to exist.\\n   Huntsville Police Maj. Robert Moder said this morning that 463\\npeople were injured by the twister, which plowed through a school\\nand rural areas as well as a shopping mall and adjacent apartments.\\n   Police Chief Richard Ottman initially put the number of dead at\\n19, but his clerk, Kitty Whitworth, later said the death toll was\\nlowered to 17 after police confirmed the count of bodies. She said\\npolice had no firm reports of people missing.\\n   No children in the school were killed, but about 30 youngsters\\nwere in a kindergarten class at the building, and five were\\nreported injured. Most of the dead were in apartments, stores or\\ncars.\\n   Mayor Steve Hettinger estimated the number of homeless at 1,000\\nand said officials were preparing a request for federal disaster\\nassistance.\\n   A worker at a building owned by the Madison County Jaycees said\\n42 people were staying there early today, and described the mood of\\nthe survivors as ``shock, mostly, and disbelief.\\'\\'\\n   ``They\\'re thankful to be alive and they\\'re thankful their\\nfamilies are alive,\\'\\' he said, adding that the shelter had received\\ncalls from around the country from worried relatives.\\n   The tornado was Alabama\\'s deadliest since a 1975 twister killed\\n22 people in Birmingham, said Danny Cooper, state emergency\\nmanagement director in Montgomery.\\n   Along a highway near a destroyed apartment complex, cars were\\nflipped and smashed into telephone poles and crushed by trees. The\\nroadway was strewn with used bandages and medical gloves left by\\nemergency workers treating the injured.\\n   Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors had\\ndifficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.\\n   Those in the tornado\\'s path spoke with awe of its fury.\\n   ``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and\\nit just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold\\nof,\\'\\' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car.\\n   Heavy overhead power lines ``started snapping just like a circus\\nperformer would snap his whip,\\'\\' Carroll said. ``All of these heavy\\narcing, flashing lines that were just popping and snapping over the\\ntop of us. ... It was as if you were looking into an arc-welder,\\nthey were so bright.\\'\\'\\n   Kenneth Lenhard had undergone an operation at the Crestwood\\nHospital on Wednesday and returned to his room about an hour before\\na window in the next room blew out as the tornado passed.\\n   ``There wasn\\'t anything I could do, so I covered my head,\\'\\'\\nLenhard said. ``I thought, `What the heck, I\\'m already half dead.\\'\\n\\'\\'\\n   The downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the Waterford\\nSquare and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to\\nrubble.\\n   Kindergarteners were the only pupils left at the school by the\\ntime the twister hit.\\n   The city is home to NASA\\'s Marshall Space Flight Center and the\\nArmy\\'s Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from\\nthe space agency or weapons testing center.\\n   At least two other tornadoes were reported in Alabama, injuring\\nat least three people in addition to the Huntsville total.\\n   Near Palmetto, Ga., resident Jeff Bryant said his home at the\\nSweetbriar Mobile Home Park near Interstate 85 began to vibrate\\nwhen the twister approached.\\n   ``Then we heard a large, loud, swirling and humming noise,\\'\\' he\\nrecalled. ``It didn\\'t sound like a train like everybody says it\\ndoes. I lived near a train track. It did not sound like a train. It\\nsounded more like a jet aircraft at very close range.\\'\\'\\n   Thomas Farr was driving on Interstate 85 when the tornado hit.\\n``It was picking up cars and tossing them like toys off the\\ninterstate,\\'\\' he said. ``I saw one 18-wheeler flip over. The car in\\nfront of us was flipped about 100 yards, and the guy was thrown out\\nof his passenger window and landed 50 feet from his car.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nA Sunday television program stated that according to a \"very reliable source,\" talks are being held between Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman and government representatives to negotiate an agreement. The 10-point agreement reportedly is aimed to stop the popular war characterized by terrorism, murders, sabotage and armed agitation and propaganda. The agreement would also dismantle the People\\'s Guerrilla Army, allow a gradual general amnesty, allow exiled members to return to Peru, and restore movement archives seized earlier. The agreement also reportedly mentions the need for economic support in the war torn areas.

His star pupil, Ben Johnson, ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds in the Seoul Olympics but lost his Gold Medal when he tested positive for drug use. Francis said that steroid use permits an athlete to train harder but not run faster. Francis says steroid use is rampant. After a two year ban, Johnson is running again without Francis\\' coaching. Francis believes that without steroids, Johnson cannot be the fastest, although still fast.\\nIntroduction:\\nSPEED TRAP; By Charlie Francis with Jeff Coplon  </LEADPARA>\\n<SECTION>  Arts &amp; Books  </SECTION>\\n<HEADLINE>  RUNNING AWAY FROM THE TRUTH  </HEADLINE>\\n<MEMO>  Books\\nBamberger is a Philadelphia Inquirer sportswriter.  </MEMO>\\n<TEXT>  St. Martin\\'s, 306 pp., $18.95\\nCHARLIE Francis, testifying in 1988 in Toronto\\nat a federal inquiry about the use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports,\\nseemed a mad scientist, something on the order of Dr. Frankenstein. Francis,\\nthe Canadian national sprint coach, knew the polysyllabic names and complex\\ncharacteristics of steroids -- furazabol, stanozolol, Dianabol -- as if they\\nwere members of his family. And although he spoke of his athletes as if they\\nwere family members, too, he made it plain, under oath, that he had given them\\nevery steroid combination imaginable, his experiments all carefully\\ncalibrated, charted and analyzed.\\nHis system had worked remarkably. On\\nSept. 24, 1988, Francis\\' most famous pupil, Ben Johnson, who immigrated to\\nToronto from Jamaica as a scrawny 14-year-old, ran 100 meters in 9.79 seconds\\nat the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. The time was a world record and gave\\nJohnson the gold medal, ahead of the defending champion, U.S. star Carl\\nLewis.\\nBut the Francis system, like all systems, was not foolproof. \"About\\n42 hours after my life\\'s greatest moment,\" Francis writes on the first page of\\nhis confessional, \"Speed Trap,\" his \"nightmare began.\"\\nJohnson, the\\nworld\\'s fastest man, had tested positive for illegal steroid use. Suddenly he\\nwas the world\\'s fastest cheat. Millions of dollars worth of endorsements\\nshriveled up. His gold medal was revoked, and his world record was, too.\\nBecause Johnson was caught, the Canadians were embarrassed. Because they were\\nembarrassed, they conducted a federal inquiry. Because they held an inquiry,\\nFrancis had to testify. And because of that testimony, we have \"Speed Trap,\"\\nan elaboration of what Francis said at the inquiry and a history of his\\nremarkable path through the world of track and field.\\nHe argues,\\nessentially, that to be a world-class sprinter, you must use steroids -- he\\nmakes this argument even as Johnson attempts a comeback for the 1992 Olympic\\nGames in Barcelona, Spain, without them.\\nSteroids do not make a runner run\\nfaster, Francis explains, but they enable a runner to train harder. The desire\\nfor speed comes with incredible costs, and they are the trap. By encouraging\\nhis athletes to use steroids -- and Francis maintains that they all wanted to\\ndo so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up --\\nFrancis argues that he is simply helping to create a level playing field.\\nWe learn that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is nothing new in the\\nworld of sports -- that cocaine and arsenic and codeine were used by athletes\\nin the 1896 Olympic Games. We learn that Johnson harmed his own world-record\\ntimes by raising his hand jubilantly as he approached the finish line. We\\nlearn that if athletes take steroids on their own, independent of an official\\n(but still illicit, of course) program, it\\'s called \"free-lancing.\" That\\'s one\\nof Francis\\' theories for why Johnson got caught.\\nBut, Francis says, there\\nis no logical reason for Johnson to have been caught. After all, he had never\\nbeen caught before. No one of Johnson\\'s standing had been caught before.\\nFrancis offers theories for the positive test result -- free-lancing,\\nsabotage, a screw-up by the team doctor -- but there is no clear answer.\\nFor all its candor, answers and revelations are not forthcoming in \"Speed\\nTrap.\" Francis, without naming names, convinces us that steroid usage is\\nrampant, but he tells us what that means to him only in a technical sense. The\\nbook lacks a strong sense of character development. It does not take any moral\\nstand; it lacks passion. How did Francis feel violating the rules? What drove\\nhim? What did he really feel toward Johnson?\\nAfter a two-year ban, Johnson\\nis running again without Francis\\' coaching. The early word is that he is still\\nextremely fast, probably one of the fastest men in the world -- but no longer\\nthe fastest. Francis would have us believe that without steroids, Johnson\\ncannot be the fastest. (Johnson disagrees.)\\nAt the end of \"Speed Trap,\"\\nFrancis says that steroids cannot be simply banned -- their use is too\\nprevalent, they can be disguised too easily and they work too well. The\\ndangers have been exaggerated, Francis says. People who want running to be a\\n\"natural\" sport are naive. \"We ceased being natural ages ago, the moment we\\nstopped running barefoot on dirt paths,\" Francis writes. \"It is a formidable\\nchallenge to distinguish between nature and artifice, a task I would leave to\\nthe philosophers.\"\\nBut \"Speed Trap\" left me wishing Francis had at least\\ntried his hand at philosophy. Isn\\'t that everyone\\'s responsibility? To ask why\\nwe do the things we do? \"But I was a sprint coach, and I had a different job,\"\\nhe concludes. \"To help a few gifted people run as fast as they could.\"\\nThey ran fast, all right. But he never seems to have asked himself: Is it\\nworth it? </TEXT>\\n<BYLINE>  MICHAEL BAMBERGER  </BYLINE>\\n<COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY>\\n<EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION>\\n<CODE>  SJ  </CODE>\\n<NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME>\\n<PUBDATE>   910324  </PUBDATE> \\n<DAY>  Sunday  </DAY>\\n<MONTH>  March  </MONTH>\\n<PG.COL>  27  </PG.COL>\\n<PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR>\\n<REGION>  WEST  </REGION>\\n<FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE>\\n<STATE>  CA  </STATE>\\n<WORD.CT>  842  </WORD.CT>\\n<DATELINE>  Sunday March 24, 1991\\n00084228,SJ1  </DATELINE>\\n<COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT>\\n<LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN>\\n<LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE>\\n</DOC>\\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nBen Johnson spent his homecoming without the gold medal and hero\\'s welcome.

The Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin called this a major environmental catastrophe and that clean-up equipment at the site was grossly inadequate. Alaska has a plan for action within five hours of a spill but it took hours longer and insufficient equipment was employed initially. A Greenpeace spokesman said the whole food chain could be affected. A Coast Guard spokesman said some blood-alcohol tests were given to crew but no results yet available. National Transportation Safety Board officials were expected on site soon.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Millions of gallons of crude oil that\\nspilled when a tanker ran aground spread across a wildlife-rich\\nstretch of ocean Saturday, and Alaska\\'s chief environmental officer\\ncriticized cleanup efforts as too slow.\\n   The biggest oil spill in U.S. history created a slick about\\nseven miles long and seven miles wide in Prince William Sound. The\\nCoast Guard said only Reef Island and the western edge of Bligh\\nIsland had been touched by the slick.\\n   ``This situation, I think, was everyone\\'s secret nightmare about\\nwhat could happen with oil traffic in the sound,\\'\\' said Dennis\\nKelso, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental\\nConservation.\\n   Some 240,000 barrels _ about 10,080,000 gallons _ of crude oil\\nfrom Alaska\\'s North Slope spilled early Friday when the 987-foot\\ntanker Exxon Valdez ran hard aground on Bligh Reef, about 25 miles\\noutside Valdez, where it had taken on a total cargo of 1.2 million\\nbarrels. Initial reports indicated 270,000 barrels had spilled.\\n   ``What we have here is a major environmental catastrophe,\\'\\' said\\none oil spill expert, Richard Golob of Boston, publisher of Golob\\nOil Pollution Bulletin.\\n   Golob said cleanup equipment at the site was ``grossly\\ninadequate\\'\\' but added that even under ideal circumstances cleanup\\nefforts would not have significantly reduced the spill\\'s impact.\\n   ``It is an enclosed body of water,\\'\\' he said. ``The only way for\\nthis oil to ecape out to the sea is by traversing the entire length\\nof Prince William Sound with all its islands, fjords and bays and\\nchannels.\\n   ``And during that transit, undoubtedly a large stretch of\\nshoreline will be contaminated,\\'\\' he said.\\n   Divers Saturday said they had found six to eight holes in the\\nvessel\\'s hull large enough to swim through, said Frank Iarossi,\\npresident of Exxon Shipping Co. About 30 feet of the vessel is\\nresting on a shelf on the reef.\\n   Efforts to begin pumping 200,000 gallons of oil off the Exxon\\nValdez onto another tanker, the Exxon Baton Rouge, were halted\\nearly Saturday when authorities noticed that oil appeared to\\nleaking as the pumping operation proceeded.\\n   Eleven of 17 tanks that lie forward of the ship\\'s masthead were\\nruptured in the accident, causing concern over removal of the oil,\\nsaid Coast Guard Lt.

De Beers bulldozed the site before leaving and all documentation about deposits disappeared. Mr. Robin Baxter- Brown, one of the new joint owners of River Ranch Mine, started his career with De Beers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience. The deposit is estimated as 17.5 million tonnes, 60% of gem quality, and there is likely another deposit nearby. Mining began in March.\\nIntroduction:\\nINVESTORS are being asked to provide money for a diamond mine near the River\\nLimpopo in Zimbabwe, which De Beers, the South African group that dominates\\nthe diamond business, discovered but then let get away.\\nThe mine is River Ranch, 12km upstream from Beitbridge on the southern\\nborder of Zimbabwe. De Beers found diamonds there in 1975 but decided to\\nconcentrate instead on another site 60km away and, importantly, given the\\nheat generated by the politics of the region, across the border in South\\nAfrica. After an investment of Dollars 500m that site went into production\\nas Venetia, one of the world\\'s biggest diamond mines.\\nThe South African group eventually gave up its rights to River Ranch in 1991\\nafter it failed to reach agreement with the Zimbabwe government about\\nmarketing the diamonds. The government insists that all minerals are sold\\nthrough its state-controlled Minerals Marketing Corporation.\\nMr Robin Baxter-Brown, chairman of Redaurum Red Lake Mines, one of the new\\njoint owners of River Ranch, said yesterday that De Beers bulldozed the site\\nbefore leaving.\\nAlso, all documentation about the deposit has mysteriously disappeared from\\nthe Zimbabwe Ministry of Mines.\\n(A De Beers official said equipment would usually be removed from a site\\nbefore it was abandoned but he could neither confirm nor deny that River\\nRanch had been bulldozed.)\\nMr Baxter-Brown is a South African geologist who started his career with De\\nBeers and has 36 years of diamond exploration experience. He helped\\nAuridiam, an Australian-quoted company that he co-founded and where he was\\nonce chairman, win the mining rights to River Ranch when they were put up\\nfor tender by the Zimbabwe government in 1991.\\nThe deposit is estimated by the joint venturers to have resources of 17.5m\\ntonnes containing 5m carats of diamonds, and since mining started in March\\nlast year it has produced 43,000 carats of diamonds, 60 per cent of them of\\ngem quality, Mr Baxter-Brown said.\\nRedaurum, which is quoted in Toronto, is raising CDollars 1.5m (Pounds\\n780,000) net of expenses via a placing by London stockbrokers Carr Kitcatt &amp;\\nAitken to help boost annual output from the present rate of 50,000 carats to\\n330,000 carats.\\nThe increase will be reached in two phases. The first, costing USDollars\\n2.1m, will raise output to 180,000 carats next year, while the second will\\ncost Dollars 8.7m. The partners have spent about Dollars 850,000 to buy and\\nmove a heavy minerals separation plant recently decommissioned at the RTZ\\nCorporation\\'s diamond mine near Mafikeng, 500km away.\\nThe joint venturers have exclusive exploration rights to 13,474 hectares of\\nground around the mine and Mr Baxter-Brown suggested the chances of finding\\nanother diamond deposit were good.\\nWhile most of River Ranch\\'s gem diamonds are small, typically under half a\\ncarat, the mine has yielded some big stones, the biggest so far being 29.6\\ncarats. A 28-carat stone was sold for Dollars 110,000 or Dollars 4,000 a\\ncarat, and one of 17 carats for Dollars 95,000 (Dollars 6,000 a carat).\\nDiamonds are being sold directly to the market in Antwerp, Belgium, and not\\nthrough De Beers\\' Central Selling Organisation, which controls about 80 per\\ncent of the world rough (uncut) diamond trade. But as Mr Baxter-Brown\\npointed out: \\'330,000 carats a year is no threat to De Beers.\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe National Hurricane Center study said that the US death toll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted as they marked the opening of the 1988 storm season.

But, as president, he is first addressing two higher priorities: deficit reduction and healthcare reform, both of which, he believes, will help alleviate welfare. He has improved the earned income tax credit and will enforce laws requiring financial support from absentee fathers. These measures may help but will not solve America\\'s welfare problems. Many conservatives favor a strict time limit, two years, for welfare. Most people consider this too drastic. Something like an FDR public sector works program, although probably not affordable, might work. Many think the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988 is the answer.\\nIntroduction:\\nPresident Bill Clinton\\'s pledge to \\'end welfare as we know it\\' was one of\\nthe most popular lines in last year\\'s election campaign. His idea of a\\nstrict two-year time limit on welfare cheques appealed to voters (especially\\n\\'Reagan democrats\\') not just as a way of cutting government spending and\\nthus reducing taxes, but as a solution to the nation\\'s most pressing social\\nproblems.\\nIn the American mind, welfare has become synonymous with such evils as urban\\ndecay, fatherless children, drug abuse and violent crime. By promising\\nradical welfare reform, Mr Clinton was sending a powerful subliminal\\nmessage: he would wage war on all the diseases that are ravaging urban\\nsociety.\\nSince becoming president, Mr Clinton has barely mentioned the word welfare,\\nraising fears that his grandiose promise will prove as cynical as former\\nPresident George Bush\\'s \\'read my lips: no new taxes\\' pledge.\\nThe White House insists that welfare reform is not forgotten but has just\\nhad to take its turn behind two even more urgent priorities: the deficit\\nreduction plan finally approved this month and the healthcare reform\\nscheduled for September. It claims both measures will help shift people off\\nwelfare by \\'making work pay.\\'\\nThe budget advanced this cause by expanding the earned income tax credit (a\\nkind of negative income tax). This gives poor working families a cash bonus\\nof up to Dollars 2,500 a year, increasing the incentive to take low paid\\njobs. If healthcare reform guarantees health insurance for all workers,\\nwelfare recipients will no longer be able to reject jobs on the grounds that\\nthey stand to lose their health care benefits.\\nIn addition, the administration promises to bolster the economic position of\\nwelfare mothers by strictly enforcing laws requiring absent fathers to\\nsupport their children financially.\\nSuch measures should help. But they are hardly going to solve America\\'s\\nwelfare problem, which differs substantially from that in Europe.\\nIn keeping with Franklin Roosevelt\\'s dictum that a permanent dole is \\'a\\nnarcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit\\', the US has never provided\\npermanent welfare support for single, able-bodied adults. When pundits talk\\nof a \\'culture of welfare\\' they are referring mainly to the Dollars 20bn\\nspent on Aid for Families with Dependent Children, a benefit received by 5m\\nsingle-parent families. The objection is not that some families in\\nstraitened circumstances need AFDC as a short-term prop, but that half of\\nthose on welfare behave as though they have a meal ticket for life.\\nSo what should Mr Clinton do?\\nMany conservatives favour the concept of a strict time limit. Once people\\naccept that benefits are not going to be paid indefinitely, they argue,\\nbehaviour will change. Teenagers will stop having babies and start\\nrecognising the economic advantages of marriage. Those whose welfare\\nbenefits expire will face a stark choice: accept low-paid employment or hand\\nover children for adoption. At first the adjustment will be horribly painful\\nbut in the longer term society will gain enormously because destructive\\nlifestyles will no longer be underwritten. With its economic life support\\nsystem (welfare) ripped away, the underclass will shrivel.\\nBut no modern president would contemplate so brutal a social experiment. If\\nwelfare stops, something has to take its place. One suggestion is that Mr\\nClinton should follow the example of Roosevelt\\'s Works Progress\\nAdministration, an agency that at its peak created over 3m public sector\\njobs. After two years, welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer\\nof a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage.\\nMothers with young children would also be offered state child care\\nfacilities. According to one advocate, this would amount to replacing the\\nwelfare state by the \\'work ethic state\\'.\\nThis solution is more appealing than a mere cessation of benefits. But it\\nwould involve a huge expansion of public sector employment and cost perhaps\\nDollars 50-60bn a year, far more than the Clinton administration is willing\\nto spend on welfare reform.\\nFortunately there is a fall back position for Mr Clinton: the bipartisan\\nFamily Support Act of 1988, which he helped steer through Congress. This\\nrecognised the impossibility of ending welfare overnight and instead set\\ntargets for the gradual introduction of \\'workfare\\'. Next year states will\\nreceive federal assistance only if they ensure that at least 15 per cent of\\nthe \\'employable\\' welfare case load is working or in training programmes; by\\n1995 the required ratio rises to 20 per cent. These seemingly undemanding\\ntargets require a much larger fraction of the welfare population to take\\njobs at some point during the year.\\nMr Clinton could tighten the definition of \\'employable\\', so as to include\\nmothers with children under the age of three, and set more demanding\\nworkfare participation targets, for example that 50 per cent of welfare\\nrecipients should be working or in training by the year 2000. Such a\\ngradualist approach would be both humane and cost effective. The only\\ntrouble is that it falls far short of the presidential promise to \\'end\\nwelfare as we know it\\'. Like Mr Bush, Mr Clinton may have raised\\nexpecta-tions that simply cannot be met.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe stripping of Ben Johnson\\'s Olympic Gold Medal has wounded Canadian pride and shamed the nation.

Scheduled to be completed in 1993, it will cut the London-Paris journey from six hours to three. It will enable freight to travel on a single train instead of being transferred to trucks for a ferry trip. Some wonder whether Britain will be ready for it. A writer on the project said, \"They\\'re still arguing about whether it will introduce rabies into this country, or let in terrorists\". Critics say obsolete commuter lines in SE England will cause delays.\\nIntroduction:\\n   A colossal tunneling machine\\nis boring beneath the English Channel from the white cliffs of\\nDover, pursuing a dream born in Napoleon\\'s time that is coming true\\nat last.\\n   Another is digging from the French coast in what the tunnel\\nbuilders call the largest civil engineering project now under way\\nin the world.\\n   The 31-mile tunnel, 24 miles of it underwater, will cut the\\nLondon-Paris journey from six hours to three, as fast as a\\nscheduled airline.\\n   It will enable freight to travel on one train instead of being\\nshifted to trucks for a cross-channel ferry trip subject to weather\\nand shipping strikes.\\n   Tunneling speed at the Dover end is less than 15 feet an hour\\nand the machine boring from the geologically more complex French\\nend moves even slower, which is why the tunnel will not open until\\n1993.\\n   For continental Europeans, accustomed to long-distance rail\\ntravel, the tunnel is but a small spur on a vast network stretching\\nto Moscow and beyond.\\n   For the British, the change wrought by what many call the\\n``chunnel\\'\\' will be enormous. Some wonder whether Britain will be\\nready for it.\\n   ``People still question whether the tunnel will be complete in\\nMay 1993 and that\\'s ridiculous,\\'\\' says Kathy Watson, co-author of a\\nbook on the project. ``They\\'re still arguing about whether it will\\nintroduce rabies into this country, or let in terrorists.\\'\\'\\n   ``They discuss it in terms of their being an island race, with a\\nchannel that has kept out invaders,\\'\\' she said in an interview.\\n   State-owned British Rail will not commit itself to building a\\nhigh-speed link from London to the tunnel in time to make the\\nthree-hour journey a reality in 1993. It intends instead to improve\\nexisting tracks.\\n   Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium that will own the\\ntunnel, is urging British Rail to speed its plans. Critics say the\\ntangle of commuter lines in southeast England, so obsolete that\\ntrains can be delayed by a sudden fall of autumn leaves, will delay\\ntunnel traffic.\\n   The consortium forecasts 16.5 million passengers in 1993 but the\\nrailroad says that figure will not be reached before 1998.\\n   Arriving channel trains will terminate at Waterloo station in\\nsouth London, at a large customs and immigration terminal. Critics\\nsay this will waste time and Britain should follow the continental\\npractice of handling such matters on the train during the journey.\\n   British stations, bridges and tunnels are not built for the tall\\nloads commonly carried across the channel. That means many loads\\nwill have to be repacked or transferred to trucks unless the\\nfacilities are rebuilt.\\n   The grandiose project has been on and off the drawing boards for\\nmore than 200 years.\\n   Napoleon wanted to bore a tunnel in 1802 but Britain\\'s generals\\nwarned him off. Digging began in 1882 but was halted by British\\nfears of French invasion through the tunnel.\\n   Britain\\'s entry into the European Economic Community engendered\\na spirit of unity and the digging began again in 1974, but two\\nyears later a new British government shelved the project.\\n   With trade barriers among the 12 EEC countries set to fall in\\n1992, Colin Kirkland, technical director of Eurotunnel\\'s on the\\nBritish side, says the tunnel will be completed this time.\\n   He says the entire cost of 5.2 billion pound ($8.8 billion)\\nproject is privately financed and cancellation would cost the\\ngovernments ``enormous penalties\\'\\' to shareholders.\\n   Also, the governments signed a tunnel treaty in February 1986\\nand both would have to agree to cancellation.\\n   ``There\\'s no way that politicians will cancel this project,\\'\\'\\nKirkland said in an interview. ``It\\'s quite difficult to get one\\ngovernment to agree. To get two is bloody nigh impossible.\\'\\'\\n   Money\\'s power to move the tunnel forward was demonstrated in\\nAugust, when drilling fell behind schedule.\\n   Eurotunnel ordered a management shakeup and threatened\\nTrans-Manche Link, the consortium of 10 British and French\\nengineering companies building the tunnel, with penalties of $25\\nmillion if the diggers did not pass the three-mile mark by Nov. 1.\\n   From a a rate of 380 feet a week, the pace quickly accelerated\\nand recently achieved a week\\'s record of 480 feet, Kirkland said.\\nThe timetable calls for 650 feet a week and Kirkland is confident\\nof reaching it.\\n   The tunnel, 80-130 feet below the seabed, was 2 miles into the\\nchannel from this end Oct. 9, the most recent measurement\\navailable, and the French had progressed about 1,300 feet. Digging\\nbegan last December.\\n   At its peak, the project will employ about 11,000 workers and 11\\ntunneling machines.\\n   Construction of the two one-way train tunnels begins in\\nDecember. A smaller service tunnel running between them now is\\nbeing dug.\\n   Tunneling machines simultaneously dig, remove rock and put up\\ntunnel walls. With a laser beam to keep the driver on course, the\\n700-foot-long behemoth creeps along, pressing curved slabs of\\nScottish granite and pulverized ash into the newly exposed tunnel\\nwall.\\n   In an emergency like flooding, the cylindrical head of the\\nmachine can expand to become a cork, blocking off the water and\\nspraying concrete into the cavity to seal the leak. Once the\\nall-clear is given, the two-story-high rotating blade with its\\ntungsten teeth resumes chewing ahead.\\n   Because the machines are too large to be removed, when the\\ndigging is complete they will be rolled aside and walled in.\\n   The tunnels are to be completed in 1991, then the railroad\\ntracks will be laid. Eurotunnel will run shuttle trains once every\\nthree minutes at peak times between terminals near Folkestone and\\nCalais, and British Rail and the Frenh state railroad will operate\\ntrains from London and Paris.\\n   Cars and trucks will drive onto the shuttle trains and be able\\nto stay in their vehicles or stroll about during the 35-minute\\ntunnel passage.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThird World debtors paid 50 billion dollars more last year than they received in new loans just to service their debt. Economic progress by the Third World has been mixed, from a mini- boom in Southeast Asia to further impoverishment in Africa. The figures on the cash drain from Third World countries are mushrooming rapidly. This is a prime indicator of the strain that the global debt is putting on the Third World. The debt of the Third World is 993 billion dollars and growing. Greater efforts are needed by the industrial nations to reduce Third World debt.\\nIntroduction:\\nThird World debtors had to pay $50.1 billion more to service their debts to the \\nUnited States and other creditors last year than they received in new loans -- \\na major drain on their already cash-strapped economies -- the World Bank \\nreported Sunday. \\n\\nThe figure, contained in the bank\\'s annual report and made public before its \\nannual meeting here Sept. 23, was almost a third larger than in 1987, when the \\nnet pay-back totaled $38.3 billion. The cash drain has been growing steadily \\nsince 1984, when it was $10.2 billion. \\n\\nThe bank also reported that, despite the relatively buoyant economic growth in \\nmost industrial countries, developing countries turned in a decidedly mixed \\nperformance, ranging from a mini-boom in Southeast Asian economies to further \\nimpoverishment in Africa. \\n\\nThe bank said that it plans to increase its own commitments for new loans to \\nThird World countries to about $16.4 billion in the current fiscal year, up \\nfrom $14.8 billion in fiscal 1988. However, actual disbursements of loan money \\nare expected to remain at about $11 billion. \\n\\nThe figures on the cash drain showed that these \"net resource transfers,\" as \\nthe bank parlance terms them, are mushrooming rapidly -- a measure of the \\nmounting strain that the global debt burden is placing on Third World \\neconomies. \\n\\nSunday\\'s total is approximately $7 billion higher than a preliminary estimate \\nof $43 billion for 1988 that the bank published last December. \"The situation \\nin the Third World is getting worse, not better,\" a bank official said. \\n\\nA bank spokesman said that part of the reason that the figure is so bloated is \\nthat some countries, such as cash-rich South Korea, are paying off their debts \\nearly. And the new U.S. plan to help countries reduce their debts is expected \\nto trim the total some. \\n\\nStill, the figure is massive by any measure. The total debt burden of Third \\nWorld countries currently is estimated at about $993 billion. The debt service \\nfor this total -- that is, the payments to cover interest and principal -- \\namounts to about $143 billion a year. \\n\\nThe bank gave a variety of reasons for the disparity in growth rates among \\ndeveloping countries. In general, however, it said that countries whose \\ngovernments follow sensible economic policies, such as in East Asia, have \\nattracted heavy new investment and have performed well. \\n\\nBut others, such as those in Latin America, the Middle East and sub-Saharan \\nAfrica, that are heavily state-owned economies and consume more than they \\nproduce, have not. In particular, investment has lagged in these countries as \\nresidents have sent their capital abroad. \\n\\nThe bank said the continuing deterioration in the debt situation underscores \\nthe need for further efforts by the industrial countries to help Third World \\ngovernments pare back their debt -- a major aim of the U.S. plan offered by \\nTreasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. \\n\\n\\nDrain Began in 1984 \\n\\nHowever, efforts under the Brady plan are going relatively slowly, and World \\nBank officials cautioned that the results may not show up for at least two or \\nthree more years. Some critics believe that the plan -- designed to let debtors \\nswap debt for securities -- may have limited use. \\n\\nThe net cash drain from the debtor countries to the richer ones began in 1984. \\nUntil then, the richer countries had provided more in new loans to Third World \\nnations than those countries paid back. \\n\\nWorld Bank officials said the outflows are likely to prompt the institution to \\nintensify its emphasis on programs that are designed to alleviate poverty, not \\njust speed development. The bank also intends to step up lending for \\nenvironmental projects. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Shining Path Central Committee, comprised of leaders who have not been arrested, held a meeting in February presided over by \"Feliciano\". Reportedly they decided to continue the \"people\\'s war\" and reject members advocating the peace accord. A five-point document reasserted the violence rising from a 1992 agreement, emphasized a 1993 position supporting political and military continuation of the people\\'s war including in cities, and condemned members seeking peace as \"the Black Group\". The leaders claim a man in prison (Guzman) cannot lead a communist organization, but hope to retain Guzman\\'s ideological principles and popular support to resume fighting.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nlearned about the Shining Path meeting, according to an \\nintelligence report datelined 31 March that states it was held \\nin Razuhuillca, Huanta Province, Ayacucho. As a result, \\nPeruvian Air Force troops carried out operations in the \\naforementioned area during the second week of April. The \\noperations, however, were unproductive. \\n  Dincote also obtained information according to which \\n\"Feliciano\" presided over the meeting, during which it was \\ndecided to start a new phase of the \"people\\'s war\" as well as \\nplan an operation to rescue Abimael Guzman, dead or alive, at \\nany cost. \\n  The five-point document issued at the end of the meeting is \\nattached to lengthy citations of speeches by Abimael Guzman and \\ndocuments signed by him that show why the war must not end. \\n  The following is one of the citations chosen by the Shining \\nPath Central Committee to uphold its decisions: \"Always taking \\ninto account the glorious actions of the people\\'s war, the \\npeople\\'s war cannot end. The leadership may be wiped out \\ncompletely or partially, but those leaders who are not must and \\ncan continue carrying out plans, the struggle, the people\\'s war. \\nWe were taught that the revolution will not stop, will not \\nbecome paralyzed.\" This was selected from the document entitled \\n\"To Conquer Power in the Midst of the People\\'s War\" that was \\ndrafted during the Second Shining Path Central Committee Plenum, \\nwhen Guzman was still free. \\n  The document even mentions what must be done with those who \\nuphold peace and put down arms: \"There are two reasons for \\nsurrendering: to surrender in view of local reaction and to \\nsurrender in view of international reaction. This is always the \\ncase. Its purpose is to ruin the revolution. Those who \\nsurrender, therefore, are no good, and must be wiped out through \\nfire and bloodshed.\" (Preliminary Session of the Second Plenum). \\n  The first of the five points discussed during the meeting \\nrefers to \"reasserting\" the agreements reached during the Third \\nCentral Committee Plenum, which was held in March 1992 and \\nheaded by Abimael Guzman Reinoso. This plenum was labeled \\n\"glorious, historic, and momentous\" as it planned the terrible \\nwave of violence unleashed by the Shining Path in July 1992. \\n  During the 1992 partisan meeting, it was stated that during \\nan adverse situation the party should draft \"a new plan, taking \\ninto account the experience of the past years, establish new \\naxes, sub-axes, guidelines, and lines of action with a \\nnationwide criteria (...), seek new ways to develop and set up \\nstrategic military plans, and establish, for example, those \\nobjectives and carry them out on an established date.\" \\n  It seems that the Third Central Committee Plenum\\'s \\nassessment \\nof what was happening to the Shining Path was negative and, \\ntherefore, it was decided to unleash a fierce wave of violence \\nin order to conceal the weaknesses of the Maoist organization. \\n  The second point of the document of the Central Committee \\nmeeting presided over by \"Feliciano\" highlights the agreements \\nof the Working Meeting of the Shining Path leadership held in \\nAugust 1993, almost one year after Guzman was arrested, and \\nduring which the implementation of the agreements of the Third \\nPlenum held in March 1992 was discussed. \\n  During the working meeting, and in addition to approving the \\nefforts to \"step up investigations to determine the sanctions \\nfor those who are found responsible\" for contributing to the \\narrest of Abimael Guzman, it was agreed, among other issues: \\n  1. To defend the life of \"President Gonzalo\" by widely \\npreaching our ideology, by showing great courage, placing even \\nour lives at stake, by keeping our red and invincible flag \\nflying high, and by pursuing our unwavering objective: \\ncommunism.\" \\n  2. To reassert the conclusions of the Third Central \\nCommittee Plenum (March 1992), \"personally presided over by \\nPresident Gonzalo, whose victorious appearance revealed its \\nglorious, historic, and momentous nature; the second most \\nimportant milestone after the congress (held in 1988).\" \\n  3. To reassert the three strategies: the political \\nstrategy: to conquer power; the military strategy: the people\\'s \\nwar, to develop the war of movements and promote arrangements \\nfor the uprising of cities; and the construction strategy: to \\nmake arrangements to conquer power in the midst of the people\\'s \\nwar. \\n  Based on the conclusions of the Third Plenum and the Working \\nMeeting, the Central Committee, during the meeting in February \\npresided over by \"Feliciano,\" reasserted \"the principle of \\nrevolutionary violence as a universal law expressed in the \\npeople\\'s war.\" \\n  The third point discussed during the Central Committee \\nmeeting headed by \"Feliciano\" referred to the militants who \\nuphold the peace accord. The document addresses this aspect of \\nthe internal debate as: \"About the Struggle Against the \\nCounterrevolutionary Hoax and the Black Group that upholds a \\nRight-Wing Opportunist Line (LOD).\" \\n  In order to confront the Black Group or LOD, which are \\nnothing but Shining Path militants who sign Abimael Guzman\\'s \\nletters and uphold his \"great decision and definition\" to \\nnegotiate with the government in order to end the war, the \\nCentral Committee demands that the militants \"grow stronger on \\nthe Basis for Partisan Unity [Base de Unidad Partidaria, BUP],\" \\nwhich is the Shining Path basic principles adopted during the \\n1988 Congress, and \"arrange for conquering power in the midst of \\nthe people\\'s war.\" \\n  The Central Committee Plenum that \"Feliciano\" presided over \\nin order to break away from the Black Group orders the \\n\"unleashing of a massive reassertion movement based on the BUP \\nthroughout the party, the People\\'s Liberation Army, and among \\nthe masses of the New Power.\" \\n  The Central Committee uses several arguments to \"urge the \\nsmashing of the counterrevolutionary nonsense and the \\nmisbegotten schemes of Yankee imperialism, the genocidal and \\ntraitorous dictatorship, and the Black Group:\" \\n  1. The agreements reached at the Third Plenum (March 1992) \\nand the working meeting (August 1993) must be ratified because \\n\"facts have confirmed that the position established on those \\noccasions toward the counterrevolutionary scheme was right and \\nproper.\" \\n  2. Abimael Guzman\\'s letters to President Alberto Fujimori, \\nthe telephone conversation between Guzman and Javier Esparza \\nMarquez (Guzman\\'s brother-in-law, who is in charge of Shining \\nPath\\'s organization abroad), and the communiques released by \\nShining Path prisoners \"are a counterrevolutionary scheme \\nconcocted by Yankee imperialists and the genocidal and \\ntraitorous dictatorship with the sinister help of the Black \\nGroup,\" the Central Committee concluded at its February meeting. \\nIt added: \"The short-term objective of this scheme is to win \\nthe elections, prevent the commemoration of (Mao\\'s) centennial \\nin December 1994, and cover up the La Cantuta affair, but the \\nfinal goal is to annihilate the people\\'s war and move ahead with \\ntheir plan to murder President Gonzalo.\" \\n  The Central Committee does acknowledge Guzman as its leader, \\nand gives him credit for the ideology he devised, the so-called \\n\"Gonzalo\\'s Thoughts,\" but now he is considered to be a merely \\ndecorative figure because neither the party nor the war can be \\nled from a cell, especially when the leader is kept \\nincommunicado and his contacts with the outside world must go \\nthrough government officials. \\n  3. The Black Group is made up of \"infiltrators, traitors, \\nweaklings, and old revisionists, linked directly to \\nreactionaries,\" meaning Osman Morote, Elena Iparraguire, Maria \\nPantoja, Martha Huatay, Edmundo Cox, and others who are in touch \\nwith government representatives and prison officials. \\n  4. The activities of the Black Group \"go against the \\nconclusions of the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist-Gonzalo\\'s Thoughts \\nFirst Congress (1988), the BUP, the leadership, the party, and \\nthe people\\'s war, which means that its members have voluntarily \\nstrayed from the party.\" \\n  This clearly means that the negotiators of the peace \\nagreement no longer belong to the Shining Path because their \\nactions openly violate the agreements, resolutions, and \\ndecisions reached at party meetings such as the Third Plenum and \\nthe Working Meeting. Thus, they do not represent the ideology \\nof the Peruvian Communist Party-Shining Path. Furthermore: \\n  5. \"Actions that go against principles cannot be accepted\" \\nbecause \"it is an international communist rule that the \\nleadership (of the party and the war) cannot be exercised from \\nprison,\" and because \"monstrosities like the `peace accord\\'(...) \\nclash with our principles.\" \\n  The Central Committee meeting that \"Feliciano\" presided over \\nclearly defined its position toward Abimael Guzman Reinoso, \\nwhose ideological contribution to the people\\'s war, called \\n\"Gonzalo\\'s Thoughts,\" was acknowledged. Gonzalo\\'s \"leadership\" \\nwas also accepted but, as he is operationally restricted, he \\ncannot lead the party anymore. \\n  Guzman and the leaders who support his decision to hold \\ntalks \\nwith the administration signed a communique that was released in \\nMarch. This communique \"warned against\" and \"denounced\" the \\nreports of \"Feliciano\\'s\" Central Committee, which decided to go \\non with the war. \\n  This communique stated: \"They are trying to separate \\n`Gonzalo\\'s Thoughts\\' from `President Gonzalo\\' the person. Under \\nthe guise of defending the party, they are undermining it and \\nits leadership so as to bring about its defeat, by using empty \\nrhetoric to disguise their partisan, opportunistic, and personal \\ninterests and ambitions, and by taking a blind, biased, \\nsubjective, and superficial approach to concrete reality. (...) \\nWe urge the eradication of these leftist ideas of military \\nextraction.\" \\n  The communique emphasized the decision to put an end to the \\npeople\\'s war: \"The people\\'s war is over. To continue it means \\nsabotaging the peace agreement. We warn our members against \\nmilitaristic and revisionist approaches, and urge them to keep \\ntheir eyes open to unmask this or any other scheme.\" \\n  Guzman\\'s call upon the militants in action to \"abide\" by \\nthe decision to hold talks with the administration in order to \\nstop the war, and to fight those who disagree with this \\ndecision, is persistent: \"Once again we warn the militants to \\nbe on guard against any desperate action, adventure, or \\nprovocation from third parties, because the goal of all this is \\nto scuttle the proposed peace agreement. Such actions must be \\nprevented to the extent possible, and immediately and \\ncategorically criticized.\" \\n  Meanwhile, the Central Committee has acknowledged \"Gonzalo\\'s \\nThoughts\" as the ideological basis for the \"people\\'s war,\" \\nGuzman Reinoso\\'s \"leadership\" and his inability to lead the \\nparty and the war from prison, and has decided to reorganize the \\nShining Path machine to launch a new stage of the war without \\nGuzman. \\n  The Dincote report lists the steps that \"Feliciano\\'s\" \\nfollowers are taking to carry out actions that would put Shining \\nPath back in the political picture. The report states that the \\nShining Path is expected \"to carry out isolated actions at key \\ntargets in order to demonstrate its operational capacity.\" \\n  Intelligence agents believe that the most likely targets are \\n\"financial companies, banks, stores, and industries, in order to \\nsow confusion among local and foreign investors.\" \\n  Other likely targets are \"soon-to-be-privatized public \\nenergy \\nand mining companies, the embassies of countries whose citizens \\nare purchasing Peruvian companies, and the interests that these \\ncountries already have in Peru. Government politicians and \\nhigh-ranking members of the forces of order are also among the \\nmain targets. In this case the objective is to obtain the \\nfreedom of Abimael Guzman Reinoso.\" \\n  The counterterrorism police believe that the Shining Path \\n\"urgently needs to demonstrate its power in order to get out of \\nits current defensive position.\" Dincote\\'s intelligence reports \\nadds that the internal strife in the Shining Path has reached \\nthe level of killings among militants, so it is likely that \\nthere will be a \"settling of accounts.\" Shining Path members \\nbelieve that surrender deserves capital punishment. \\n  The Dincote report, which confirmed that \"Feliciano\" \\npresided \\nover a Shining Path Central Committee meeting somewhere in \\nRazuillca, added that it has been decided to \"rescue Abimael \\nGuzman Reinoso, dead or alive.\" The report explains that \\n\"Israeli experts in hostage rescue and underwater operations \\n(demolition) have been hired for this purpose.\" \\n  The Shining Path also considered the possibility of winning \\nover Peruvian security forces personnel \"so as to attract new \\nmembers, including Armed Forces Special Operations personnel.\" \\n  The 21-page police report labeled Dincote-EM-2-Lima provides \\na detailed analysis of the behavior of the Shining Path and the \\nTupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement throughout the country. \\n  According to \"Feliciano\" and his followers, Guzman Reinoso \\nhas fallen prey to a plot designed to murder him. \"Feliciano\" \\nclaims that the \"forged letters\" sent to President Alberto \\nFujimori, the communiques supporting the peace agreement signed \\nby Shining Path prisoners in Canto Grande, Chorrillos, and \\nYanamayo, and the statements and gestures of Osman Morote \\nBariionuevo and Edmundo Cox Beuzeville are all part of this \\nplot. As far as \"Feliciano\" is concerned, rescuing Guzman \\nReinoso, dead or alive, is just a symbolic gesture in any case. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe official opening of the Channel tunnel on May 6 should be the starting point for recovery in the property market in Kent and Northeastern France.

That should be the starting signal for a recovery in the property\\nmarket in Kent and north eastern France.\\nAt the moment, agents report more inquiries, but the markets in both\\ncountries are still quiet and prices low, especially in France. That is an\\nexcellent long-term reason to buy.\\nLe Shuttle\\'s high starting prices for a vehicle and its passengers will\\neventually come down creating price competition between rail, ferry,\\ncatamaran and Hovercraft.\\nFar-sighted prospective buyers looking near Calais include hauliers wanting\\nto set up a base on the Continent, and Asian entrepreneurs who see an\\nadvantage in being close to Belgium. John Hart, author of A House in France,\\nnotes: \\'It is not a rush. The tunnel does not mean much to the continentals.\\nMost of the ferry trade is from Britain to France.\\'\\nThe British are mainly looking for houses, rather than apartments, although\\nFrench and Dutch buyers are also in the market. Inquiries about northern\\nFrench property picked up just before Christmas, says Maggie Kelly, of\\nFrench agents L\\'Abri-tanique in Hesdin.\\nGrowing confidence in the UK market is slowly stimulating interest in French\\nproperty. UK buyers can now sell their UK home to put money into a main\\nresidence or second home in France. Prices have stopped falling in northern\\nFrance and hopes are high that the tunnel, motorways and new railways will\\nresuscitate the region.\\nBritons who bought in 1989 or 1990 may find it a good time to sell, if they\\ndid not pay too much at the time and have renovated their properties since.\\nBut some paid far too much.\\nSpectacular price cuts can be found. For example, a glorious, repossessed\\nabbey with five acres in Tortefontaine, with a 12th century hall and many\\noutbuildings, is on sale at around FFr750,000 (Pounds 86,000) from agents\\nLatitudes or L\\'Abri-tanique. Four or five years ago it cost FFr2.5m (after\\nbeing put on the market at FFr4m). A mill near Montreuil, which cost FFr2m\\nin 1989, sold last year for FFr500,000.\\nFrench banks and mortgage providers have taken it \\'on the chin\\', said Kelly,\\nand some smaller banks in Calais are none too happy when Britons seek loans.\\nHowever, show you have the cash and there are bargains to be had. A house in\\nHesdin, or a nearby country cottage, make good weekend retreats and are far\\ncheaper than their English equivalents.\\nA small house in Montreuil, a walled town with cobbled streets, costs\\nFFr280,000 from La Residence. A small, partly-restored farmhouse near\\nMontreuil can be bought for FFr135,000 from A House in France. Thirty\\nminutes\\' drive from Boulogne, a long, low, Norman-style, half-timbered,\\nfarmhouse is for sale at FFr515,250, and 50 minutes away another costs\\nFFr436,800 (reduced from FFr650,000).\\nNear St Omer agent Cote d\\'Opale is selling an 18th century chateau with\\nwings added in 1908 for FFr4.46m. La Residence offers another with 28\\nwatercress beds and 12 hectares (30 acres) in good condition for FFr2.6m and\\na flat in town for FFr380,000.\\nIn Hesdin, the Wine Society, an English-based group of wine enthusiasts, has\\nan outlet for members where they can pick up society-recommended wines free\\nof UK taxes.\\nWhen Kelly sees Range Rover and Jaguar drivers collecting their cases of\\nwine in Hesdin, she would like them to drop into her office 100 metres away\\nand choose a house as well.\\nLatitudes has on its books an 18th century town house with internal\\ncourtyard for FFr1.3m, a snip when you think what you would pay in Paris.\\nNear Fruges is a water mill for FFr900,000 and, in the valley of the\\nTernoise, an 18th century brick house needing work is available for just\\nFFr450,000.\\nOn the coast, Boulogne is a smart, pleasant town far preferable to Calais.\\nIt has good shops - including the Philippe Olivier cheese shop  - and\\nrestaurants. The French favourite is Le Touquet, still an elegant place for\\nParisians to spend le weekend. Shops open in winter on Saturdays and Sundays\\n -and close on Wednesdays and Thursday mornings. You can play golf and\\ntennis, ride, go to the casino and live in an elegant domaine in the Foret.\\nAs in Deauville, the town\\'s cachet has kept prices up. Penny Zoldan, of\\nLatitudes, has a flat in Le Touquet and sees it as a good base for\\nforeigners.\\nNearby, at Hardelot, there are plenty of building plots for sale beside the\\ntwo golf courses (consult Latitudes). Outside Le Touquet, A House in France\\noffers a chateau complete with fortification wall and tunnels for FFr1.3m.\\nIn the countryside beyond Dieppe, a typical Norman house, restored and\\nincluding most of the furniture and a cottage, is for sale for Pounds\\n125,000 from Domus Abroad.\\nTowards Paris, off the autoroute from Calais, Philip Hawkes is selling the\\n18th century Chateau de Pronleroy for FFr13m. Egerton and Knight Frank &amp;\\nRutley is offering the more recent Chateau de la Chaussee, near Chantilly,\\nthe centre of French racing, at FFr19m.\\nAt the other end of the tunnel Cluttons reports Belgians and Dutch\\nregistering at the Canterbury office for period cottages for around Pounds\\n200,000, and French and Belgians at the Folkestone office - where David\\nParry reports that Arabs are interested in blocks of flats on the sea front.\\n\\'The tunnel has more psychological impact than anything. Vendors see it as a\\nbonus. Buyers don\\'t see that yet.\\'\\nOnce the tunnel is open, said Parry, industry will be attracted to the area\\nand people will move in. Central and east Kent need a stimulus but it may\\ntake four or five years before there is any evidence of new opportunities in\\nthe area.\\nAn apartment in The Grand at Folkestone, the former hotel, is for sale from\\nCluttons for Pounds 89,500. Along the M2, Strutt &amp; Parker offers 52 St\\nMargaret\\'s Street, Rochester, a Grade II* late 17th century house, for\\nPounds 190,000, and a Tudor (1508) and Georgian Kentish hall, Cobrahamsole\\nHall at Sheldwich near Faversham for Pounds 275,000.

Net farm income decreased in drought areas by almost $10,000. Farms in all areas continued to improve their solvency position, and the number of financially vulnerable farms continues to decrease. Farms survived by selling- off inventories, taking advantage of higher market prices, and receiving the disaster relief money. The report noted higher prices helped reduce the direct payments to farmers under USDA\\'s commodity programs.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Two years ago, it looked as if a vast part of\\nthe nation\\'s farm empire was burning up as drought and heat parched\\ncrops and livestock.\\n   But the 1988 drought wasn\\'t as bad as it might have been,\\naccording to an Agriculture Department analysis. Crop yields\\nplummeted, but commodity prices rose. For those who eked out some\\nproduction, or had grain stored from previous years, it wasn\\'t too\\nbad.\\n   The latest postmortem of the 1988 drought\\'s effects was written\\nby Gerald W. Whittaker of the department\\'s Economic Research\\nService. It concentrated on the most severe drought region,\\ncentered in nine states of the Midwest and upper Great Plains.\\n   All of the information used in the study was from USDA\\'s annual\\nFarm Costs and Returns Survey, which includes detailed income and\\nexpense information derived from personal interviews of farm\\noperators.\\n   Basic findings:\\n   _Net farm income decreased in 1988 in the drought region to an\\naverage of $28,899 per farm from $38,122 in 1987. Income in\\nnon-drought areas rose to $62,822 in 1988 from $50,967 in 1987.\\n   As used by the agency, net farm income includes gross income\\nfrom farming during the calendar year, including federal payments,\\nminus costs of production. It also includes allowances for changes\\nin the value of inventories and adjustments for depreciation and\\nother factors.\\n   _Despite drought, farms in all areas of the country continued to\\nimprove their solvency position in 1988.\\n   _The number of farms considered financially vulnerable continued\\nto decrease in 1988 in both the drought and non-drought regions.\\n   _Farms in the drought region received lower direct government\\npayments in 1988, despite an infusion of federal disaster relief.\\n   _The average farm in the drought region survived financially by\\nselling off inventories and taking advantage of higher commodity\\nmarket prices to redeem price support loans made by USDA\\'s\\nCommodity Credit Corp.\\n   No state-by-state breakdowns were included in the report. The\\nnine states studied as the ``drought region\\'\\' were Illinois,\\nIndiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South\\nDakota and Wisconsin.\\n   In the category of net farm income, the report said the share of\\nfarms in a ``favorable financial position\\'\\' in 1988 held fairly\\nsteady at 68 percent in the non-drought region, compared with 69.1\\npercent in 1987.\\n   In the drought states, 62.2 percent of the farms were said to be\\nin favorable financial position, compared with 62.8 percent in 1987.\\n   ``Even with lower incomes, farmers in the drought region\\ncontinued to improve their debt position (in relation to assets),\\'\\'\\nthe report said. ``A major factor in their improvement was the\\ncontinued upward trend in land values.\\'\\'\\n   The report noted that higher market prices helped reduce the\\ndirect payments to farmers in 1988 under USDA\\'s commodity programs.\\nNationally, those payments dropped to $9.8 billion from $11.5\\nbillion in 1987.\\n   But Congress also provided nearly $3.9 billion in emergency\\ndrought aid to farmers in 1988. The nine states in the study\\ncollected about $2.57 billion, or two-thirds of the total.\\n   Hunters and others returning to the United\\nStates from Mexico with animal trophies might run into some\\nobstacles at the border.\\n   The Agriculture Department says inspectors are on guard against\\nitems that can carry Boophilus ticks into the United States.\\n   ``This tick, which carries bovine babesiosis _ a serious cattle\\ndisease often called Texas cattle fever _ was eradicated from the\\nUnited States in 1943,\\'\\' said James W. Glosser, administrator of\\nthe department\\'s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\\n   Strict measures are being taken to prevent the reintroduction of\\nthe tick, he said.\\n   For example, animal carcasses with hides attached are not\\neligible for importation into the United States. Hides that have\\nbeen tanned or soaked in a saltwater solution with mineral acid,\\nand dry antlers can be imported from Mexico without restriction,\\nprovided they are certified to be of Mexican origin.\\n   Glosser said raw and untreated hides and antlers may qualify if\\nthey are certified by the Mexican government to have been treated\\nfor ticks. Alternately, they may be dipped at one of several\\nMexican cattle export facilities along the border.\\n   The Agriculture Department is using tiny wheat\\nfields of one square foot each to monitor the spread of leaf and\\nstem rust in the Southeast. Results have been mixed.\\n   John Roberts, a scientist in the department\\'s Agricultural\\nResearch Service, said the tiny plots are planted in July about 20\\nmiles apart along an interstate highway route through Georgia,\\nFlorida, Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, then looping back into\\nGeorgia.\\n   The pilot study was begun in 1986. That was a drought year in\\nthe region, and so was 1987.

Recipients want the security of a favorable credit rating. These microloans cancel out the need to get involved with loan sharks. Third world banks and large development organizations are making such loans as well, particularly when they discovered that the repayment rate by the poor is nearly 100 percent. Some charitable organizations still prefer to make per-to-person sponsorships and the teaching of skills to improve the quality of life.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nYou think it would be utter folly to lend money to a Third\\nWorld nation? So, how about a Third World vegetable stand?\\n\\nU.S. development organizations are finding that some of\\nthe world\\'s poorest entrepreneurs repay their debts at rates\\napproaching 100%. To encourage grass-roots private business\\nin Latin America, Asia and Africa, these organizations are\\nexpanding programs that already lend thousands of these\\nstruggling entrepreneurs amounts ranging from $50 to several\\nhundred dollars.\\n\\nTiny Third World businesses commonly repay these\\n\"microloans\" faithfully because they crave the security of a\\nfavorable credit rating. This rescues them from the clutches\\nof loan sharks -- microloans typically charge the prevailing\\nlocal commercial loan rate -- and lets them borrow again in\\nhard times. The money helps them start or expand their\\nbusinesses -- selling vegetables, sewing, repairing shoes,\\nmaking furniture and the like -- and boosts their local\\neconomies.\\n\\nTheir repayment performance shines when compared with that\\nof many sovereign nations. It also looks good compared with a\\ndefault rate of 17% by U.S. recipients of federally\\nguaranteed student loans.\\n\\nThough microlending has been around for years, it is now\\nbooming. With the decline of communism, U.S. development\\ngroups believe they are exporting free-market economics to\\ntiny businesses that can fuel growth in the developing world.\\n\\n\"Micro-enterprise lending is the hottest thing in\\ndevelopment since the Green Revolution. Everybody does it,\"\\nsays Accion International spokeswoman Gabriela Romanow. The\\nGreen Revolution sent farm output surging in many poor\\nnations.\\n\\nMs. Romanow cites the case of Aaron Aguilar, an unemployed\\nfactory worker in Monterrey, Mexico, who borrowed $100 to buy\\nclay and glazes for making figurines with his wife in their\\nback yard. In six years, the couple took out and repaid five\\nloans and built their business to 18 full-time employees.\\n\\nSometimes borrowers have to struggle against setbacks that\\nmight seem comical in the prosperous West. One group of women\\nin Cameroon received $100 from New York agency Trickle Up to\\nstart a rabbit-breeding business, but the rabbit ate her\\noffspring, recalls Mildred Leet, co-founder of the U.S.\\nagency. Undaunted, the women switched to chickens and made\\nenough money selling eggs to branch out into tomatoes and\\ntailoring, ultimately opening two shops, Ms. Leet says.\\n\\nSome Third World commercial banks are taking note of poor\\nentrepreneurs\\' repayment rates. Accion persuaded family-owned\\nMulti Credit Bank of Panama City, Panama, to start making\\nmicroloans two months ago. Isaac Btesh, a director and son of\\nthe founder, says the bank has lent $80,000 to 100 people so\\nfar on 60-day, rotating lines of credit -- with a 100%\\nrepayment rate. \"When we got in touch with Accion, we were\\nincredulous,\" Mr. Btesh says. \"We couldn\\'t believe their\\nfigures. But everything they said is true.\"\\n\\nPoverty lending has such promise that Multi Credit plans\\nto make it the bank\\'s number one activity, ahead of trade\\nfinancing, consumer loans and merchant loans, the official\\nadds.\\n\\nAccion, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit international\\ndevelopment group and a leader in the U.S. microloan\\nmovement, says it plans to increase its microlending this\\nyear to $66.5 million from $37.8 million in 1990 and $9.8\\nmillion five years ago. It says it plans to add 64,000 new\\nclients, up from 40,000 last year and 9,000 five years ago.\\nIts average loan is $303.\\n\\nAccion\\'s Ms. Romanow says the group, which serves Latin\\nAmerica, plans to expand the lending to a total of between\\n$500 million and $1 billion over the next five years. The\\npayback rate is 98%.\\n\\nCARE, New York, perhaps the world\\'s largest private\\ninternational-development group, says small economic-activity\\ndevelopment -- primarily microlending -- is its\\nfastest-growing portfolio. \"There\\'s energy and creativity out\\nthere, people bootstrapping who aren\\'t waiting for the next\\nhandout,\" says Larry Frankel of CARE.\\n\\nTrickle Up, which makes thousands of $100 loans annually,\\nsays its budget rose to $1 million this year from $800,000 in\\n1989 after doubling almost every year throughout the 1980s.\\nTrickle Up makes $100 loans in two installments of $50 each\\nto small groups of individuals. \"We feel private enterprise\\nis the way to help the poor,\" says Mrs. Leet, who founded\\nTrickle Up with her husband in 1979. The group started a\\nprogram in China in 1989 and moved into Laos, Vietnam and\\nNamibia last year.\\n\\nBetsy Campbell, economic-development manager of Westport,\\nConn.-based Save the Children, says her group underwent a\\nshift in the 1980s \"from being primarily a charitable\\norganization\" to being one oriented towards helping\\nprofit-making activities. She says microlending to\\nindividuals in 20 nations is rising sharply, with more than\\n$3 million in circulation at the moment. Repayment rates in\\nmost nations exceed 90%, she says. \"These people value access\\nto credit so highly that default isn\\'t really a problem,\" she\\nsays.\\n\\nSome Third World banks, notably in Asia, have been making\\nmicroloans for years. Grameen Rural Bank of Bangladesh is\\nconsidered a pioneer. However, most such banks were set up\\nwith state support specifically to target the poor.\\n\\nNot every charity group in the U.S. has joined the\\nmicroloan bandwagon. The Christian Children\\'s Fund of\\nRichmond, Va., sticks to relief efforts and to\\nperson-to-person sponsorships, in which a U.S. donor makes\\nregular payments to an impoverished Third World child, for\\nexample, while Africare House in Washington, D.C., focuses on\\nhelping cooperatives improve food production and health care.\\n\\nNor is the booming field of microlending without its\\ndetractors -- or its controversies. David Munro, an official\\nwith TechnoServe of Norwalk, Conn., says he prefers to work\\n\"on a larger scale, and I also don\\'t see {microlending} as\\npassing on much in the way of skills.\"\\n\\nAnd officials at the U.S. Agency for International\\nDevelopment, which finances a big chunk of many private\\ngroups\\' overseas operations, say they support the principle\\nof expanding poverty lending but oppose congressional efforts\\nto mandate minimum levels. AID has more than doubled its\\nmicro-enterprise budget, which includes microlending,\\ntraining and other activities, to an estimated $114 million\\nthis year from $58 million in 1988.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nWith a shoestring budget, NAFTA foes have worked for 3 years to win over the American public. They have signed a Declaration of War against NAFTA, written alternative menus featuring toxic-laden Mexican produce for a Trade Representative dinner, driven caravans through states showing films of Mexico\\'s environmental degradation, and financed an office for \"anti-NAFTA czar\" former Indiana congressman Jim Jontz. NAFTA\\'s business-community proponents are spending millions to convince Congress to pass NAFTA, bypassing the voters. Both sides are cranking up lobbying efforts for this week\\'s conclusion of talks over labor and environment side agreements, which the opposition calls a fig leaf.\\nIntroduction:\\nIN California, labour leaders, environmentalists and the \\'Perotistas\\'\\nsupporting Mr Ross Perot have signed a Declaration of War against the North\\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. The site of the signing ceremony in\\nSacramento sent a warning to the city\\'s congressman, Mr Bob Matsui, one of\\nthe leading proponents of Nafta in the US House of Representatives.\\nIn Washington state, Nafta opponents wrote alternative menus for a dinner\\ngiven for Mr Rufus Yerxa, the Deputy US Trade Representative. These featured\\nthe potential chemical content of the dishes if the free trade pact becomes\\na reality and allegedly toxic-laden Mexican produce floods into the US.\\nAnti-Nafta crusaders drove caravans through Tennessee, California and Texas\\nto mobilise opposition. Equipped as information centres, the vans cruised\\nfrom town to town showing films and slides of the environmental degradation\\nin Mexico.\\nWith just a shoestring budget - no more than Dollars 200,000 (Pounds\\n134,230) a year in cash - foes of Nafta have worked for three years to mount\\na massive campaign to win the hearts and minds of the American public.\\nNafta\\'s US proponents - mostly the business community - are spending\\nmillions, bypassing the voters, to convince Congress to pass Nafta.\\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released last week showed 31 per cent of all\\nAmericans in favour of the pact, a slight increase from previous surveys,\\nwhile 29 per cent are opposed. However, 63 per cent believe Nafta will cost\\nUS jobs.\\nAlthough the Clinton administration weeks ago said it would appoint a \\'Nafta\\nczar\\' to shepherd the pact through Congress, it has yet to announce it has\\nfound anyone to take on the task. By contrast, the opposition has an\\n\\'anti-Nafta czar\\' in place and making speeches around the country.\\nHe is Mr Jim Jontz, a former Indiana congressman. Nafta foes have pooled\\ntheir meagre resources to provide him with a campaign office, and field\\nlegislative directors. Forty-one states have been organised, and every two\\nweeks the organisers hold long conference calls to plot strategies.\\nNafta foes around the country say their protests have persuaded congressman\\nto back away from support of the deal. One California gubernatorial hopeful,\\nMs Kathleen Brown - sister of former Governor Jerry Brown - has been stalked\\nby demonstrators, who even follow her to fundraising events.\\nAccording to Mr Craig Merrilees, director of California\\'s Fair Trade\\nCampaign, Ms Brown has expressed doubt about the pact, along with the rest\\nof the state\\'s Democratic establishment.\\nWith the expected conclusion this week of the talks over side agreements on\\nlabour and environment, both sides are preparing to crank up their lobbying\\nefforts.\\nThe opposition is not awaiting an announcement of the details, said Ms Lori\\nWallach, one of the opposition\\'s leaders.

Use special Mylar glasses or punch a hole in a piece of paper and look downward at the shadow. You will sense the eclipse better from a mountaintop or from your roof. Most of the Bay area is expected to be sunny. However, it may still be foggy along the coast. Do not look at the sun through the fog. The next major eclipse will be in another 151 years.\\nIntroduction:\\nIt\\'s E-Day. But before you rush out to see whether the moon is blocking the\\nsun, here\\'s a question-and-answer guide to today\\'s eclipse.\\nQ What time is\\nthe eclipse?  \\n\\nA Although television networks were pushing to have the eclipse in prime time,\\nnature refused to cooperate. In San Jose, the eclipse will begin at 10:10\\na.m., peak at 11:20 a.m. and end at 12:34 p.m.; Q What is an eclipse?\\nA A\\nsolar eclipse occurs when the Earth\\'s moon moves into a position to impede the\\nsun\\'s rays.; Q Can I look at the sun?\\nA No, a thousand times no. You\\'ll burn\\nyour retina, causing permanent damage. You shouldn\\'t look at the sun through\\nfilm negatives, a camera viewfinder or sunglasses, either. So stand under a\\ntree and watch the shadows. Or punch a hole in a piece of paper and look\\ndownward at the shadow.; Q Where can I get those goofy eclipse eyeshades?\\nA\\nOrion Telescope Center in Cupertino has sold out of the special glasses\\ndesigned for viewing the eclipse safely. A few welding supply stores offer\\n\"Mylar\" glasses. But some astronomers warn that there is no guarantee that\\neven these glasses will prevent eye damage.\\nQ Where is the best spot to\\nexperience the eclipse?\\nA Contrary to popular belief, you will not get a\\nbetter sense of the eclipse on a mountaintop or from your roof. The major part\\nof the shadow will fall mostly through Mexico and Hawaii, where it will get\\ntotally dark. The Bay Area gets cheated and will see the moon block only about\\nhalf the sun\\'s diameter.; Q Can I still get to Baja or Hawaii in time?\\nA Most\\nflights to Baja are booked. And it\\'s too late to make it to Hawaii. So you\\'re\\nmissing 2,000 golfers who will play a shadowy round there with balls that glow\\nin the dark.; Q Can overcast skies block the eclipse?\\nA In most parts of the\\nBay Area, skies are expected to be sunny. But along the coast, the morning fog\\nis not likely to have cleared. The eclipse will still be visible through the\\nhaze, astronomers say, and the shadows there may actually be more interesting\\nthan in sunny San Jose. Again, don\\'t stare at the sun, even through fog.\\nQ\\nCan children go outside?; A As long as they don\\'t look at the sun.\\nQ Can I\\nsunbathe in the nude during the eclipse?\\nA As long as you don\\'t open your\\neyes.; Q When is the next major eclipse?\\nA In another 151 years. By then, you\\nmay be able to shuttle to the moon and watch it from there.  \\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nLawmakers are having difficulty coming to an agreement on whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the 1990 census. The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to count all the \"persons\" in the country every ten years for purposes of reapportionment of seats in the house of representatives. It does not specify citizens. Some representatives feel that illegal aliens, if counted, may give some states like California and Texas and extra seat. Since there is a 435-seat limit, some representatives fear that their states may loose a seat. In the past, every state has counted legal and illegal aliens in the census.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question\\nof counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whether\\nfollowing the letter of the Constitution results in a system that\\nis unfair to citizens.\\n   The forum was a Census subcommittee hearing on bills which would\\nrequire the Census Bureau to figure out whether people are in the\\ncountry legally and, if not, to delete them from the counts used in\\nreapportioning seats in the House of Representatives.\\n   ``This is a fairness issue,\\'\\' said Rep. Thomas J. Ridge, R-Pa.,\\nwho contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens\\nbenefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra\\nseats in the House.\\n   Because there is a 435-seat limit, when one state gains a House\\nmember another must lose one.\\n   Ridge cited the 1980 census, which estimated the number of\\nillegal aliens at 2 million. The result, he said, was that Georgia\\nand Indiana lost House seats to New York and California.\\n   Subcommittee Chairman Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., however, said\\nhe is unsure whether the bills backed by Ridge and others are\\nconstitutional.\\n   The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to cound all\\nthe ``persons\\'\\' in the country every 10 years for purposes of\\nreapportionment. It doesn\\'t specify citizens.\\n   ``I am disturbed by the implication that undocumented residents\\nof the United States are not `persons,\\'\\'\\' Dymally said.\\n   Noting that at times in the past blacks and Indians have been\\nexcluded from participation in government, he commented: ``I do not\\nwant to return to a time when some human beings are considered less\\nthan equal in the eyes of the law.\\'\\'\\n   ``Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted\\nall residents of the states, including both legal and illegal\\naliens,\\'\\' added Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif. ``It was never the\\nintent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment\\npurposes.\\'\\'\\n   And Rep. Albert G. Bustamente, D-Texas, termed the worry over\\ncounting aliens ``hysterical,\\'\\' pointing out that the movement of\\nAmericans into western and southern states has had a much larger\\neffect on representation than the presence of aliens.\\n   The Census Bureau also opposes the bills, contending that the\\neffort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay and\\ncomplicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell the\\ntruth anyway.\\n   But Reps. Tom Petri, R-Wis. and William F. Goodling, R-Pa.,\\nasserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens\\' basic\\nright to equal representation by giving greater voice in Congress\\nto states where the aliens live.\\n   And Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., contended that counting aliens\\n``in effect, is granting representation in Congress to individuals\\nwho have entered this country by breaking the laws of the United\\nStates.\\'\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nChronology of the Exxon Valdez oil spill: March 24, the tanker runs aground; March 30, Exxon fires Captain Joseph Hazelwood after determining he was drunk; September 15, Exxon suspends beach clean up for the winter claiming a job well done but Alaskan officials disagree; January 22, Hazelwood goes on trial in Anchorage; February 27, a federal grand jury indicts Exxon and its subsidiary on five criminal counts; March 22, the jury finds Hazelwood guilty of negligent discharge of oil but innocent of more serious charges.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Here is a chronology of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, its cleanup\\nand related developments:\\n   March 24: The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez runs aground on Bligh\\nReef some 25 miles south of Valdez, Alaska, spilling nearly 11\\nmillion gallons of North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound.\\n   March 26: Alaska fishermen\\'s union spokeswoman Riki Ott says the\\ngroup wants full compensation for damage from the spill.

All aboard presumably died, including the wife of the American Ambassador to Chad. Intelligence specialists in Washington believe the bombing may be in retaliation against France for its recent Lebanese activities. France has been trying to broker a settlement there between Christian and pro-Syrian forces. The DC-10 was owned by the French airline UTA and crashed Tuesday, September 19, after taking off from N\\'Djamena, Chad. Anonymous callers claimed responsibility on behalf of the Islamic Jihad.\\nIntroduction:\\nA French DC-10 jetliner with 171 people aboard experienced a powerful \\nhigh-altitude explosion, possibly from a terrorist bomb, before crashing in a \\nremote desert region of Niger in northern Africa, officials in France said \\nWednesday. \\n\\nIn Washington, intelligence specialists said they believe that the jetliner may \\nhave been bombed by people seeking to retaliate against France for its recent \\nactions in Lebanon. \\n\\nFor several months, France has played an active part in the Lebanon crisis, \\nattempting to broker a settlement between Christian and pro-Syrian forces. \\n\\nLate last month, the French government sent a naval task force of five warships \\ninto Lebanese waters as part of what President Francois Mitterrand called a \\n\"rescue mission\" for several thousand French nationals living in the war-torn \\ncountry. But the action was widely perceived as an attempt to provide \\nprotection and support for Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and his Maronite Christian \\nforces against Syrian troops and Muslim militias in Lebanon. \\n\\nEver since, one intelligence official said Wednesday, the French government has \\nrealized that its planes were being targeted for some sort of terrorist attack. \\n\\nThe DC-10 operated by the French airline UTA crashed Tuesday after taking off \\nfrom N\\'Djamena, Chad, on a flight that originated in Brazzaville, Congo. French \\nmilitary helicopter crews who visited the crash site in the desolate reaches of \\nthe Sahara Desert late Wednesday afternoon found no survivors. Included among \\nthe presumed dead was the wife of the American ambassador to Chad. \\n\\nOn Wednesday, Michel Friess, a spokesman for UTA, said that \"the wide surface \\nover which the debris of the airplane has been found suggests a high-altitude \\nexplosion that leads one to think of a criminal attack.\" \\n\\nAnonymous callers to the airline office in Paris and to a Western news agency \\nin London claimed responsibility for the crash on behalf of the Shiite Muslim \\nterrorist organization Islamic Jihad. \\n\\nThe London caller linked the attack to the seizure of a Shiite cleric, Sheik \\nAbdel Karim Obeid, by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon on July 28. \\n\\nSaying he was reading a statement from Islamic Jihad, the London caller \\ndeclared: \"We are proud of this action, which was very successful. We would \\nlike to say the French are warned not to exchange information regarding Sheik \\nObeid with the Israelis no more. We demand the freedom of Sheik Obeid, and \\notherwise we will refresh the memories of the bombings in Paris of \\'85 and \\'86. \\nLong live the Islamic Republic of Iran.\" \\n\\nHowever, the message made little sense in the context of France\\'s limited role \\nin the Obeid matter. \\n\\nA more likely possibility, speculated terrorist experts and one intelligence \\nsource in Washington, was a terrorist attack on behalf of pro-Syrian Muslim \\nforces in Lebanon. \\n\\nThe French Foreign Ministry declined to comment Wednesday about the possibility \\nof a terrorist attack. \"The pieces are widely scattered, so it didn\\'t crash on \\nimpact,\" a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. \\n\\nAir controllers lost contact with UTA Flight 772 less than an hour after it \\ntook off from N\\'Djamena. The sudden loss of contact was another explanation \\ngiven by the French airline authorities supporting the theory of a terrorist \\nexplosion. \\n\\n\"If there had been a very serious problem on board, other than an explosion or \\nthe sudden disintegration of the airplane,\" said UTA spokesman Friess, \"there \\nwould have been at least several seconds or minutes for the crew to \\nre-establish contact.\" \\n\\nUTA officials insisted that the DC-10 was in good working condition, having \\ncompleted 60,000 hours of flying time on 14,700 flights in 16 years of service. \\nSince it was formed in 1949, UTA, which specializes in African and Pacific \\nroutes, had never experienced a crash during a commercial flight. \\n\\nHowever, in 1984 a UTA DC-8 aircraft flying the same route was damaged by a \\nbomb explosion before takeoff at the N\\'Djamena airport. Twenty-five people on \\nboard were injured in that attack, which the Chadian government blamed on \\nLibya. Chad-Libyan relations have recently normalized after a 10-year guerrilla \\nwar. \\n\\nAt the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. government\\'s \\ninformation on Tuesday\\'s disaster was limited. \\n\\n\"We can\\'t at this time state for a fact that (the plane) was blown up, but it \\ndoes have those appearances,\" he said. \\n\\nIn Santa Monica, a RAND Corp. analyst, Bruce Hoffman, said Wednesday he \\nbelieved the attack was probably staged by Shiite Muslim groups concerned that \\nFrance might intervene in Lebanon on behalf of the Maronite Christians led by \\nAoun. \\n\\n\"It seems to me that there\\'s a much stronger Middle Eastern context than an \\nAfrican context,\" Hoffman said. \"It could be that the Maronites\\' opponents in \\ngeneral were determined to deliver some sort of a knockout blow in Lebanon, and \\n(it) was designed as a warning to make the French think twice. \\n\\n\"This would send a pretty clear message to France that they ought to back \\naway,\" Hoffman added. He noted that by the end of August, \"all the main Shiite \\nplayers in Lebanon had threatened some sort of retribution against France.\" \\n\\n\\nThreats by Militants \\n\\nOn Aug. 20, the Revolutionary Justice Organization threatened to \"strike deep \\ninto the heart of French territory.\" Three days later, Hezbollah threatened to \\nstage suicide attacks against French targets. On Aug. 25, a previously unknown \\ngroup, the Organization in Defense of the Oppressed, threatened to strike \"at \\nFrench interests everywhere.\" \\n\\nAn Air France flight on Aug. 28 was delayed for more than five hours before \\ntaking off from Dulles International Airport in Washington when security \\nofficials received a last-minute bomb threat. According to one well-informed \\nintelligence official, both French and American officials took that threat \\nseriously and searched all the luggage on the plane before allowing it to \\ndepart. \\n\\nWhile France\\'s willingness to bargain with terrorists for the freedom of \\nhostages had in the past created a modus vivendi that appeared to spare the \\ncountry from violent attacks, Hoffman and other analysts suggested that the \\nstakes in Lebanon had become too important for those old rules to apply. \\n\\n\"In these people\\'s eyes, we\\'re really talking about Lebanon\\'s future. That \\nwrenches the entire struggle in Lebanon onto a higher plateau,\" Hoffman said. \\n\"The last battle for Beirut has yet to be fought.\" \\n\\n\"If it\\'s not the beginning of the end of things there, it\\'s certainly the \\nopening of a new wave of conflicts there,\" agreed another analyst, Jim \\nBlackwell of Georgetown University\\'s Center for Strategic and International \\nStudies. \\n\\nAnother analyst at the center, Robert Kupperman, discounted the possibility \\nthat a small terrorist group alone could have been responsible for the airborne \\nbombing. \\n\\n\"When someone puts a bomb on the plane, it normally takes the resources of a \\nstate, at least to set it up,\" Kupperman said. \\n\\nApart from Syrian-backed Lebanese forces, Kupperman suggested that Libya and \\nIran also could have been motivated to stage such an attack. \\n\\nAccording to intelligence specialists, security at the airport in Chad at which \\nthe plane stopped is under the control of French officials. However, the French \\ndo not control airport security in Brazzaville, the city from which the plane \\ntook off. \\n\\nThe waiting room at Paris\\' Charles De Gaulle Airport, where the flight was \\nscheduled to land, was tense and somber after the plane was first reported \\nmissing Tuesday night. \\n\\nIncluded among the passengers was Bonnie Pugh, wife of the U.S. ambassador to \\nChad, Robert L. Pugh. The State Department said six other Americans were \\naboard. \\n\\nMrs. Pugh was on her way to the United States for her daughter\\'s wedding, \\naccording to her sister, Sally Johnson, of Brawley, Calif. The ambassador\\'s \\nwife, who was born in Los Angeles in the 1920s and later moved to the Imperial \\nValley, had decided to travel ahead of her husband to help plan the October \\nwedding of their 26-year-old daughter Anne in suburban Washington, D.C. \\n\\nAnother passenger aboard the plane was Chadian Planning Minister Mahamat \\nSoumaila, en route to Washington to attend a meeting of the International \\nMonetary Fund. \\n\\nMost of the passengers were African. French officials said the victims included \\n31 Frenchpassengers. \\n\\nTempest reported from Paris and Mann from Washington.

By next spring, many seeds released from rock-hard pine cones will be fertilized by nutrients leaching into the soil from the now-packed ash, will sprout. Grasses and several types of wildflowers are already sprouting less than seven weeks after the fire. Next year, the ground cover replacing the park\\'s burnt stands of aging lodgepole pines should provide a 30-fold increase in plant species. The new growth will attract a larger variety of birds and other animal life to the area.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nWearing a bright yellow flame-retardant shirt, Donald Despain crouches down to study the ash-covered forest floor. \\nThe scorched hillside around him appears utterly lifeless. \\n\\n\\nAlmost everything in sight is black, from the tips of trees 40 feet above the ground to the powdered ash blanketing the earth. \\nThe firestorm that raged through here in recent weeks was driven by 60-mile-an-hour winds that fanned temperatures to more than 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit. \\nThe fire was so intense that a gray shadow on the forest floor is all that remains of a fallen log. \\n\\n\\nWhere many people recoil at the sweep of nature\\'s destructive power, the 47-year-old Mr. Despain marvels at the tiny steps life is already taking to renew itself. \\nAs Yellowstone National Park\\'s research biologist, he has already begun to monitor the forest\\'s rebirth from the worst fire on record. \\n\\n\\nHis eyes red from the blowing ash, Mr. Despain patiently counts the quarter-inch lodgepole pine seed \"wings\" within a rectangular frame he places on the hillside. \\nThe tiny seeds are slowly released from rock-hard pine cones only after the cones have been seared by the passing flames; indeed, they require a fire to propagate themselves. \\nThe little wings act like the rotary blades of a helicopter in dispersing the seeds. \\n\\n\\n\"This is amazing,\" says Mr. Despain, reflecting on his count. \\n\"This works out to one million seeds an acre.\" \\nOnly about 500 mature trees were on an acre of hillside here before the fire. \\nOf course, not all the seeds will become trees. \\nDeer mice will eat some of them. \\nOthers won\\'t take root. \\nBut next spring many of the seeds, fertilized by nutrients leaching into the soil from the snow-packed ash, will sprout, along with a bouquet of grasses, flowers and shrubs, as burnt areas of the park erupt with life. \\n\\n\\nThe profusion of pine seeds is just one of the rejuvenating forces at work in Yellowstone even as the fires, largely quenched this week by rain and snow, still smolder. \\nGrasses and several types of wildflowers, ranging from fireweed to wild geraniums, are already sprouting less than seven weeks after fire roared past Grant Village near Yellowstone Lake. \\nNext year, the ground cover replacing the park\\'s burnt stands of aging lodgepole pines should provide a 30-fold increase in plant species. \\nMore edible plants, in turn, support larger, and more various populations of birds and other animals. \\n\\n\\n\"We see what\\'s going on here not as devastation and destruction, but, rather, rebirth and renewal of these ecosystems,\" says John Varley, Yellowstone\\'s chief of research and Mr. Despain\\'s boss. \\n\\n\\nMr. Despain\\'s research should play a major role in a new debate over whether to reforest burnt areas of Yellowstone or to let nature take its course. \\nIn recent years, environmentalists have for the most part succeeded in promoting the natural processes of the parks. \\nBut the approach is again under attack. \\nThe National Park Service has already been at the center of a much-publicized political firestorm over its 16-year-old \"natural burn\" policy, which allows lightning-caused fires to burn themselves out, except where they threaten towns or park buildings. \\n\\n\\nCritics, including elected officials from Western states and the logging and tourist industries, have grabbed headlines by blaming that policy for fueling the inferno that this summer raged over half of Yellowstone\\'s 2.2 million acres and cost more than $100 million to fight and clean up. \\n\\n\\nReforestation would give wooded areas in Yellowstone a \"five-year jump\" on natural regrowth of the woods and would \"get it green again,\" says John Davis, Willamette Industries Inc.\\'s general manager for Western timber logging operations in Lewiston, Idaho. \\nGerald M. Freeman, the president and chief operating officer of Stone Forest Industries Inc., agrees: \"Controlled burning, selective logging and reforestation are a much better way to manage the forests.\" \\n\\n\\nThe pressure to bring back Yellowstone\\'s forest through reforestation may get intense. \\nIn an average year, 2.5 million tourists visit the huge park, and a drop-off because of the fire damage could severely hurt business. \\nIn August, with fires out of control, the tourist trade was off 30% here. \\n\\n\\nThe emotional appeal of replanting the parks already has led to some reforestation proposals -- some of them a bit off the wall. \\nNew Jersey\\'s governor, Thomas Kean, for instance, announced that his state planned to donate thousands of evergreen seedlings to replant Yellowstone, apparently without realizing that none of the proffered species are indigenous to the park. \\nAlthough the offer was later amended to include native varieties, the park service politely declined. \\n\\n\\nMr. Despain hopes that the scientific evidence that park researchers are gathering will testify to the forest\\'s ability to renew itself, while countering emotional calls for human help. \\n\"When I hear the word \\'re-vegetation,\\' my blood runs cold,\" he says. \\n\\n\\nMr. Despain joined the park\\'s research department in 1971 after finishing his doctorate at the University of Alberta on the plants of the Bighorn Mountains in northern Wyoming. \\nHe worked under Glen Cole, the park\\'s head of research from 1968 to 1976 and a leading advocate of letting natural processes prevail in the park. \\nAlston Chase, an author and park critic, describes Mr. Despain as one of the park\\'s \"most orthodox believers\" in the official natural management policy. \\n\\n\\nMr. Despain has set up or is planning several long-term research projects to study the effects of this year\\'s fires. \\nIn addition to his seed-counting, Mr. Despain has created nine \"before and after\" study plots to gauge effects of the fire. \\n\\n\\nWithin these 15-by-25-meter plots, he and other researchers cataloged the size and the number of lodgepole pines, as well as the variety of plant growth on the forest floor. (He had to abandon one such study area two weeks ago. \\nFire licked at its corners even as he was mapping the trees within.) \\nAfter the fire is out, he surveys damage to a plot. \\nNext spring he will chronicle rebirth. \\n\\n\\nSome of the impulse to reforest Yellowstone may be based on a misapprehension of just how much damage has been done here. \\nTelevision pictures of the Yellowstone\\'s fires at their height made things look worse than they are. \\nTrue, fire boundaries within the park cover about half the park\\'s acreage. \\nYet only 10% to 15% of land within these boundaries was scorched by raging crown fires that burn everything in sight, Mr. Varley estimates. \\n\\n\\nIn fact, nearly half the area within the fire zones remains untouched by fire. \\nDriving along the 140 miles of the park\\'s upper and lower scenic loop -- on roads open to park visitors -- one sees a Yellowstone that is a patchwork of green, brown and blackened forest and meadow. \\n\\n\\nThe burnt \"snags,\" as charred tree trunks are called, creak in the wind above Mr. Despain and are all that remain of a forest section that sprouted after a fire swept through here about the time of the Civil War. \\nThe slow-growing trees, only seven to 10 inches in diameter, were relatively young by Yellowstone standards. \\nMost of the lodgepole stands here that burned this summer were 250 to 400 years old. \\n\\n\\nMr. Despain says it is no coincidence that most burnt trees here were senior citizens, relatively speaking, and highly susceptible to fire. \\nAs lodgepoles age, they lose some of their natural resistance to disease and insects. \\nDead trees fall to the forest floor, joined by others blown over by the strong winds howling down from surrounding peaks. \\n\\n\\nThe thinning canopy then lets more light through to the forest floor. \\nGrasses and shrubs, some of their seeds having lain dormant for 100 years or more, fill in the open spaces between the trees. \\nThe ground clutter thickens, more trees fall, and, with the help of a prolonged drought, the old forest creates its own funeral pyre. \\n\\n\\nThe last fire to rival this year\\'s in intensity roared across much of Yellowstone in the early 1700s. \\n\"Fires have been an integral force in the Yellowstone ecosystem for the past 10,000 years since the glaciers left,\" Mr. Varley says. \\n\"Most plant species have adopted one means or another to ensure their survival.\" \\n\\n\\nMr. Despain takes a Swiss army knife from his pocket and digs into the forest floor. \\nThe top layer of the sandy brown soil has been seared by flames. \\nBut less than an inch beneath the surface the searing stops. \\n\\n\\nSeeds that have been dormant for decades beneath the soil appear to be triggered by the passing fire, he says, and will germinate next spring. \\nMeanwhile, nutrients that were bound up in the cells of mature pines for hundreds of years have been returned in the form of ash to the soil as fertilizer for next year\\'s growth. \\n\\n\\nCarol Shively, a park ranger-naturalist at Grant Village in Yellowstone, says, \"Next spring is going to be a spectacular one for wildflowers.\" \\n\\n\\nFor the first five years after a fire, while surrounding vegetation is still relatively low, there will be a proliferation of wildflowers in the park, she says. \\nIn addition to fireweed and wild geraniums, lupen, yarrow, mountain dandelion and arnica have already been spotted this year among the ashes. \\n\\n\\nAspen trees, whose paper-white bark and yellow leaves punctuate the evergreen forests this time of year, also thrive after a fire. \\nWith their roots undamaged by the flames, aspen trees return to their juvenile phase for three to four years, and will add as much as four feet in a 90-day growing season. \\n\\n\\nYellowstone\\'s meadows rebound the fastest after a fire. \\nBy next July, one will find it difficult to tell which meadows burned in 1988. \\nOne clue will be that the Idaho fescue, blue bunch wheat grass and pine grass growing in fields where fire returned nutrients to the soil will be as much as a foot taller than the meadows that escaped the flames. \\n\\n\\nForests visited only by ground fires will rebound almost as quickly. \\nShrubs and grasses cover what is left of the burnt undergrowth, although fire scars will be visible on some trees for years. \\n\\n\\nThe completely burned forests will remain a mixture of meadow and snags for several years. \\nInsects begin attacking the snags almost immediately after a fire, and the charred trunks are likely to be toppled by the wind. \\nBut many snags, weathering to fence-post gray, will remain as monuments to the fire of 1988 for years to come. \\n\\n\\nLodgepole pine seedlings grow as much as a foot a year in the open, although a few inches per year is more common at first. \\nHundreds of plant species proliferate after a fire until \"canopy closure\" is achieved in about 40 years. \\nAt that point, the pines -- still less than 15 feet tall -- begin to choke off light reaching the forest floor as their limbs grow together. \\nAs lodgepoles come to dominate the ecosystem, other plant species decline in number, reaching a low of no more than a dozen in the mature forest. \\nThe mature forest \"has the least biological diversity of any habitat in the park,\" Mr. Varley says. \\n\\n\\nThen the forest thins as it ages, trees fall, underbrush grows, and the forest is primed for a fire to start its life cycle over again. \\n\\n\\nMark Palmer, the chairman of the Sierra Club\\'s national wildlife committee, sees another virtue in the aftermath of a fire: \"Meadows are much more valuable to wildlife than dense forests.\" \\nThree to five additional bird species are likely to migrate into Yellowstone next year, attracted to the new plants and insects thriving in the meadows. \\nAmong the new arrivals may be the three-toed and blackbacked woodpeckers, the mountain blue bird and the Western wood phoebe. \\n\\n\\nMemories of Bambi and Smokey the Bear notwithstanding, Yellowstone\\'s large animals don\\'t appear to have suffered from the fire. \\nThere has yet to be a confirmed report of a large animal killed by the flames, although a few deaths are almost inevitable, park officials say. \\n\\n\\nYellowstone\\'s elk and bison herds, as well as moose, should benefit from the additional forage in the park next year. \\nIt\\'s too early to tell whether the fires, which burned some lower pastures, affected the herds\\' ability to weather Yellowstone\\'s long winter. \\nMore winterkill among the herds might be expected this year in any case, since animal populations are now near their historical upper limits. \\nThe park service is under unwelcome political pressure to feed the herds if the winter is severe. \\n\\n\\nMoving up a link in the food chain, Yellowstone\\'s grizzly bear and mountain lion populations would be the obvious beneficiaries of an increase in winterkill among the grazing animals, according to Mr. Varley. \\n\\n\\n\"Ecologically, there\\'s no down side to the fire,\" he adds, conceding that similar statements by park officials may have sounded cavalier when the fires were raging. \\n\\n\\nThey certainly did seem that way to some people. \\nWyoming\\'s U.S. senators, Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Alan K. Simpson, are mindful of the damage the fires caused the state\\'s tourist industry this year, as well as the threat to gateway towns near the park. \\nThey have called for the resignation of William Penn Mott Jr., who heads the park service. \\n\\n\\nSo far, Mr. Mott, who didn\\'t return calls for comment, doesn\\'t appear in danger of losing his job, park service officials say. \\nBut Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel says he favors certain, unspecified changes in the natural-burn policy. \\nA panel of academics and scientists is being assembled to study this year\\'s fires and make recommendations on what changes might be in order. \\nCongressional hearings are also likely. \\n\\n\\nBeautiful as they are, trees aren\\'t the reason most people come to Yellowstone National Park. \\nOn a recent evening, about a hundred park visitors made the pilgrimage to one of the world\\'s natural wonders -- the largest concentration of geysers to be found anywhere on earth. \\nThese and the rest of the park\\'s thermal features remain unscathed by the fires. \\n\\n\\nThe sun had just set with an ash-tinted tangerine glow behind the hills to the west. \\nA quarter moon was visible as well. \\nAt exactly 7:24, as predicted by the sign in the window of the tourist-information office, Old Faithful sputtered once, twice and shot plumes of white steam high into the fading light. \\nTourists will be back next year for this . . . and perhaps to see how nature is restoring the forest. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nA United States Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed and burned in Britain this morning while on a routine training flight.

The softening of the Slovene attitude is an effort to adapt Slovene policy to that of the European Union, which Slovenia wants to join. Yugoslavia is distrustful and resents Slovenia\\'s attitude toward Kosovo and support of arms for Bosnia. It expresses interest in normal relations but says before they can take place, Slovenia must apologize for its rebuff of Yugoslavia\\'s offer to recognize Slovenia a year ago, and must end its anti- Serbian campaign.\\nIntroduction:\\nIn the view of Yugoslav diplomats, the \\nnormalization of relations between Slovenia and the Federal \\nRepublic of Yugoslavia will certainly be a strenuous and \\nlong-term project. Although the establishment of communications \\nbetween Ljubljana and Belgrade would be very important for the \\nsituation in the former Yugoslavia in general, the chances that \\nthis could happen soon are minimal. \\n  A signal that relations between Yugoslavia and Slovenia \\nmight \\nbe reconsidered came this time from the Slovene capital. \\nAccording to information published in the Yugoslav newspapers, \\nthe Slovene Government could be addressing this issue soon. The \\nestablishing of relations between the two states, the exchange \\nof diplomatic representatives, and the abolition of the visa \\nrequirement for Yugoslav citizens are some of the topics to be \\nconsidered. This information has not been denied and, apart \\nfrom that, it is the logical conclusion to a series of \\nstatements issued by Slovene politicians, which pointed to a \\nchange in relations toward Belgrade. \\n  The announcement about the normalization of relations were \\nalso supported by information that an official Slovene \\ndelegation had arrived in Belgrade for this purpose, but it was \\nstated that the details cannot yet be published since the matter \\nis very delicate. \\n  The FRY Ministry of Foreign Affairs is denying that any \\nofficial Slovene delegation came to Belgrade. It is stated that \\nthis is rather a visit of businessmen, since these contacts have \\nnot been interrupted. It is assumed in the Federal Ministry of \\nForeign Affairs that Slovene businessmen might even be checking \\nthe atmosphere for possible political contacts, but there have \\nbeen no official statements about it. \\nCommercial contacts  The signals from the Slovene side are being received in \\nYugoslavia with reservations. One could even say with distrust. \\n  Yugoslav diplomats point out that Yugoslavia has not been \\nofficially recognized by Slovenia. It is also true that \\nSlovenia does not accept Yugoslavia on the international scene. \\nYugoslav sources claim that Slovenia is becoming increasingly \\nisolated because of its extreme policy toward Yugoslavia, so \\nthat this might be one of the reasons why it has decided to \\n\"soften\" its attitudes toward Yugoslavia. \\n  Official Belgrade has not forgotten \"the extremist, \\nanti-Serbian statements issued by Milan Kucan in Albania\" or the \\nmoves made by Slovene statesmen who \"instead of soothing the \\npassions, stirred them up, always to Serbia\\'s disadvantage.\" \\n  After reporters remarked that this relatively negative \\nattitude might negate the unofficial signal from Ljubljana, a \\nYugoslav diplomat said: \"We do not think that there is only one \\nopinion in Slovenia about Yugoslavia. Slovenia is the former \\nYugoslav republic that made the greatest effort to harm the \\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. I am now speaking about the \\nofficial Slovene attitude, not about the attitudes of all the \\npoliticians, and especially not about the attitudes of the \\nSlovene people.\" Yugoslav diplomats have the impression that \\nthere are differences between Milan Kucan, the president of \\nSlovenia, Lojze Peterle, the minister of foreign affairs, and \\nJanez Drnovsek, the prime minister, the last being \"sober, \\nrealistic and trustworthy.\" \\n  The first signs of a change in the Slovene attitude toward \\nYugoslavia were noticed during the visit of Karolos Papoulias, \\nthe Greek foreign minister, and Vaclav Havel, the Czech \\npresident, to Slovenia, in November 1993. \\nDiplomatic Pirouettes  At that time the press carried statements made by Milan \\nKucan \\nand Lojze Peterle that unquestionably represented a shift in \\npolicy toward Belgrade. Kucan said that \"Slovenia never had any \\nconflict with Serbia,\" and Peterle that \"Slovenia would be happy \\nif the conditions for the removal of the sanctions against \\nSerbia and Montenegro were fulfilled.\" \\n  At the beginning of December 1993, Mr. Peterle, the Slovene \\nminister of foreign affairs, made that attitude concrete in a \\nletter to Warren Christopher, the U.S. secretary of state, in \\nwhich he wrote: \"A possible removal of the sanctions against \\nYugoslavia is being fully considered since the aims for which \\nthey were introduced have not been achieved.... The European \\nUnion initiative makes us hope that the situation in the Balkans \\ncan be solved.\" \\n  In the view of Slovene political commentators, the softening \\nof the Slovene attitude toward the FRY is a part of the \\ndiplomatic tactics the aim of which is to adapt Slovene policy \\nto the policy of the European Union, with which Slovenia is \\nawaiting negotiations about associate membership. Belgrade \\ndiplomats agree with this assessment and claim that the first \\nannouncement of possible contacts between Yugoslavia and \\nSlovenia were made by arrangement with Germany and Austria. \\n  In the focus of Serbian attention now are relations with \\nCroatia, and as far as Slovenia is concerned, the official \\nproposal for the normalization of relations has to be specified \\nfirst. Single statements and \"diplomatic pirouettes\" are not \\nenough to overcome the present differences, including the \\nSlovene attitude toward Kosovo, the interruption of economic \\nrelations, the way Slovene independence was achieved by force, \\nand diplomatic duels on the international scene. \\n\\n[Box, p 7]Jovanovic: \"Slovenia Must Excuse Itself\"  \"In order to enter the process of normalization of relations \\nwith Slovenia, certain conditions must be fulfilled first,\" \\nVladislav Jovanovic, FRY minister of foreign affairs, said in a \\nstatement for POLITIKA, and added: \"First it is necessary for \\nSlovenia to excuse itself for the rude and impertinent move it \\nmade a year ago in refusing the Yugoslav offer of recognizing \\nSlovenia. It is further necessary that the anti-Serbian \\ncampaign that Slovenia has been spreading all over the world is \\nended and that it acknowledges that those who remained in \\nYugoslavia have the right to self- determination. Apart from \\nthat, Slovenia must stop challenging the continuity of \\nYugoslavia as a state. \\n  Slovenia made a mistake by insisting that the FRY be \\nexcluded \\nfrom all international forums. In addition, Slovenia supports \\nthe lifting of the arms embargo on the Bosnia- Herzegovina \\nMuslims. There are many situations that prove that Slovenia has \\na hostile attitude toward Yugoslavia. We are not bothered that \\nSlovenia is an independent state. On the contrary, while we \\nlived together, we had excellent relations. That is why our \\nsurprise was great when the turnaround occurred. \\n  Yugoslavia is interested in good relations with all of its \\nneighbors -- old and new alike. Slovenia is no exception. We \\ncannot account for the hostility that they have shown toward \\nYugoslavia and toward the people who are living in this region \\nnow. Official Slovenia should find ways and means to end this \\nhostility. We are, of course, interested in normal relations \\nbetween Slovenia and Yugoslavia, but some prerequisites have to \\nbe fulfilled,\" Jovanovic concluded his statement. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Solomon Islands experienced an earthquake at 8:05 p.m. today, measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale. There were no immediate reports of injury or damage, not surprising since the area is sparsely populated and minimally developed. No tsunami was reported. This was the strongest quake reported in the world in the last five months; the epicenter was placed on Guadacanal Island. The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. That means a reading of 7.5 shows an earthquake ten times stronger than a quake of 6.5.\\nIntroduction:\\n   A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the\\nRichter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today,\\nthe U.S. Geological Survey says.\\n   The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1\\nmagnitude earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17.\\n   The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today, or 5:05\\np.m. EDT Friday, said USGS spokesman Don Finley. It was the largest\\nearthquake in the Solomons since a 7.4 quake on Nov. 5, 1978.\\n   There were no immediate reports of injury or damage. Major\\nearthquakes in the Solomons usually don\\'t cause much damage or many\\ncasualties because the area is sparsely populated and not\\nextensively developed.\\n   The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said no\\nPacific-wide tsunami _ popularly called a tidal wave _ was\\ngenerated by the quake, but some areas might see small changes in\\nsea levels.\\n   Saturday\\'s earthquake was the strongest in the world in five\\nmonths, Finley said. An 8.3 quake hit the Macquarie Islands south\\nof Australia on May 23.\\n   The survey\\'s earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., said early\\nseismograph readings placed the epicenter of Saturday\\'s earthquake\\nabout 200 miles southeast of Honiaria, which is on Guadacanal\\nIsland and is the capital of the Solomons.\\n   That places the earthquake just east of San Cristobal, the\\neasternmost island in the Solomons chain and about 1,300 miles\\nnortheast of Brisbane, Australia.\\n   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on\\nseismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase\\nin magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times\\nstronger than one of 6.5.\\n   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight\\ndamage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,\\n6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major\\'\\' earthquake, capable of\\nwidespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great\\'\\' quake, capable of\\ntremendous damage.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nMeteorologist William Gray predicts more intense Atlantic hurricanes in the coming decade or two unlike the 1970s and 1980s because of an apparent break in the African drought. Rainfall in the Sahel, typically associated with more intense hurricanes was above average in 1988 for the first time since 1969. Hurricane Hugo had sustained winds of 150 mph and an atmospheric pressure of 27.1 inches. Officially a four, Hugo may have been a borderline 5. The threat of global warming may also portend hurricanes more powerful says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of MIT. To develop, Hurricanes need ocean surface temperatures of above 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe names will be different, but more hurricanes with the powerful punches of \\nHugo and Gilbert may be prowling the Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in \\nthe future. \\n\\n\"The probability of more intense hurricanes in the Atlantic region is greater \\nin the next decade or two than it has been in the 1970s and \\'80s,\" says \\nmeteorologist William M. Gray of Colorado State University, who analyzes \\nhurricane patterns. \\n\\nGray predicts a possible return of the more ferocious hurricanes of the \\'50s \\nand \\'60s, because of an apparent break in the periodic West African drought. \\nRainfall in the Sahel, typically associated with more intense hurricane \\nactivity, was above average in 1988 for the first time since 1969, he says. A \\nsecond rainy summer this year indicates an end to the drought. \\n\\nThe most intense hurricanes, Gray explains, usually form at low latitudes from \\ntropical disturbances moving westward from Africa. The well-watered conditions \\nin the \\'50s and \\'60s produced 31 of the most severe kind (categories 4 and 5) \\nin the 17-year period 1950 to 1967. \\n\\nHurricanes are classified by the Saffir-Simpson scale, the fiercest a No. 5, or \\ncatastrophic storm. The atmospheric pressure at its center drops drastically \\nand its wind speed exceeds 155 m.p.h. \\n\\nIn the drier 17-year period of 1970 to 1987, there were only 13 severe storms. \\nIn the \\'88 and \\'89 seasons -- June through November -- there have been five. \\n\\nLast year\\'s Gilbert, which left a wide swath of devastation across Jamaica and \\nthe Mexican Yucatan, was the mightiest hurricane on record in the Western \\nHemisphere. Its atmospheric pressure dropped to 885 millibars and its wind \\nspeed reached 200 m.p.h. \\n\\nThis September\\'s Hugo, which ripped through the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico \\nbefore clobbering South Carolina, had sustained winds of 150 m.p.h. and an \\natmospheric pressure of 918 millibars (27.1 inches). Officially a 4 on the \\nSaffir-Simpson scale, it \"may be a borderline 5,\" says meteorologist Mark \\nZimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. \\n\\nThe strongest recorded storm on Earth, Zimmer says, was 1979 Typhoon Tip in the \\nwestern Pacific, with a low pressure of 870 millibars. Outside the Atlantic \\narea and the eastern Pacific, hurricanes are called typhoons or cyclones. \\n\\nFortunately, most Atlantic-region hurricanes do not develop to their worst \\npotential. In this century, only two No. 5 hurricanes have struck the United \\nStates with full force, the 1935 Labor Day storm that ravaged the Florida Keys \\nand 1969\\'s Camille, which slammed ashore at Mississippi and Louisiana. In 1980, \\nAllen, the mightiest Caribbean storm then recorded, had lost much of its punch \\nbefore it hit the Gulf Coast of Texas. \\n\\n\"If the future is like the past with its pattern of atmospheric conditions, \\nthere is a good probability of the return of stronger storms,\" Gray said. \\n\\nBut in the 1990s, he warns, U.S. destruction will be at least four to five \\ntimes more costly than in the \\'50s and \\'60s, because of the boom in population \\nand property development along coastal areas. \\n\\nThe threat of global warming also portends hurricanes more powerful than any \\nyet recorded, says meteorologist Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute \\nof Technology. \\n\\nHurricanes are like huge, self-sustaining heat engines spinning across the sea. \\nThey get their power from the water\\'s warmth. To develop, they need tropical \\nocean-surface temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. \\n\\n\"If tropical ocean temperatures go up, the intensity of hurricanes will,\" \\nEmanuel explains. \"Sea-surface temperatures set the upper limits.\" \\n\\nThe biggest uncertainty, he says, is whether global warming will affect \\ntropical ocean temperatures. \\n\\nThe gradual warming of the Earth results from the greenhouse effect, caused \\nprimarily by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, \\nwhich, like the glass of a greenhouse, trap heat. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\n1990 is fast becoming one of the worst years on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and southern sections of the country. One tornado in Kansas was the strongest since 1985. Flooding in the South and the Plains has been as destructive as the tornadoes. Studies of tornadoes indicate they are concentrated in regions for five or six year periods. Parts of the Midwest, particularly Kansas and Missouri, seem to be entering such a trend. However, because computers allow meteorologists to see more sources of data more clearly, warning of impending storms is becoming more sophisticated leading to fewer deaths.\\nIntroduction:\\n   1990 is fast becoming one of the worst\\nyears on record for tornadoes and flooding across the middle and\\nsouthern sections of the nation.\\n   So far this year, 726 tornadoes have touched down nationwide,\\nwell ahead of the 640 tornadoes recorded during the first six\\nmonths of last year, and the 30-year average of 482 tornadoes\\nrecorded between January and July, said Frederick Ostby of the\\nNational Severe Storms Forecast Center here.\\n   The nation had 747 tornadoes in the first six months of 1973 _\\none of the biggest years for tornadoes since 1950, when the\\nforecast center began keeping reliable records of the storms. There\\nwere 756 tornadoes reported in 1982.\\n   ``We seem to be on a pace that would put us up with those two\\nyears,\\'\\' Ostby said.\\n   The culprit in this tornado barrage across the Plains is a\\npersistent West Coast pattern of low pressure in the upper\\natmosphere that is keeping the jet stream anchored at a southern\\nlatitude.\\n   This year\\'s storms seem particularly violent, as illustrated by\\nthe March 13 tornado that cut a swath a mile wide and brought winds\\nof 300 mph to a field in Kansas. The tornado was the strongest to\\nhit the United States since 1985.\\n   The first weekend in June saw the worst outburst of tornadoes\\nsince 1974. Ostby said 101 tornadoes touched down from Kansas to\\nKentucky, leaving nine people dead.\\n   But a break in the storm pattern may be at hand.\\n   As summer wears on, the land warms up and cold air from Canada\\nretreats. This moves the boundary of the jet stream to the north,\\nOstby said.\\n   ``Our longer range computer forecasts are suggestive of that.\\nThere is some kind of a readjustment beginning to take place in the\\nupper atmosphere,\\'\\' he said.\\n   However, a study of tornado trends indicates parts of the\\nMidwest, particularly Kansas and Missouri, are heading into a\\nsix-year period of more intense tornadoes.\\n   The study of tornadoes since early this century shows that they\\nare concentrated in regions for five- or six-year periods, said\\nMichael Smith, president of WeatherData Inc.\\n   But warning of impending storms is becoming more sophisticated,\\nleading to fewer deaths. Tornadoes have caused 20 deaths this year,\\nwhile an average year in the 1980s saw 52 deaths, and in the 1970s\\nnearly 100, Ostby said.\\n   ``There are better watches, better warnings and a better\\nresponse,\\'\\' Ostby said.\\n   Ostby credited the quicker response to computers that allow\\nmeteorologists to see many sources of data, such as satellite\\nreadings, more clearly.\\n   Flooding in the South and the Plains has been as destructive as\\nthe tornadoes.\\n   The death toll from last week\\'s flash floods in Shadyside, Ohio,\\nrose to 21 on Monday, making the flood one of the most deadly in\\nrecent years. Authorities held out little hope for more than a\\ndozen others listed as missing.\\n   Wegee and Pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped 5{\\ninches of rain in 3{ hours. The floods destroyed as many as 70\\nhouses and damaged up to 40, officials said.\\n   Flooding in Texas has been blamed for at least 16 deaths since\\nApril. An estimated 10,000 people were forced from their homes, and\\nhigh water caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nBritish government experts reassured the public yesterday that it is safe to eat beef and that there is no scientific evidence of a causal link between \"mad cow\" disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE) and human Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD). Anxiety had been raised by news that a dairy farmer whose herd had a case of BSE in 1989 died last year of CJD. Both diseases are caused by particles of infectious protein called prions. There has been no change in the incidence of CJD, however, while the incidence of BSE has continued to grow.\\nIntroduction:\\nGOVERNMENT veterinary and health experts were yesterday putting out\\nreassuring messages about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or \\'mad\\ncow\\' disease, in the face of growing public anxiety.\\nDr Kenneth Calman, the government\\'s chief medical officer, yesterday\\nrepeated the official advice that beef can be eaten safely: \\'There is no\\nscientific evidence of a causal link between BSE in cattle and CJD in\\nhumans.\\'\\nOne cause of concern is that the number of cases is continuing to rise, in\\nspite of forecasts from the Ministry of Agriculture that the incidence of\\ncases would peak last year and then decline rapidly. Farmers reported 8,581\\nanimals with BSE during the first nine weeks of this year compared with\\n8,099 in the same period last year.\\nAnother fear is that BSE could cause illness in humans. It was revealed this\\nweek that Mr Peter Warhurst, a dairy farmer whose herd had a BSE case in\\n1989, died last year of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. Both BSE and CJD are\\ncaused by mysterious particles of infectious protein called prions.\\nDr Robert Will of Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, who is monitoring all\\nCJD cases in the UK for the Department of Health, drew attention to Mr\\nWarhurst\\'s case without naming him in the Lancet, a medical journal. He says\\nhe now regrets writing to the Lancet because of the unnecessary alarm\\ncaused.\\nStatistical analysis, taking account of the average national incidence of\\nCJD and the number of people working on BSE-affected dairy farms, shows that\\nthe probability of one CJD case having occurred among the latter group by\\nchance is about 1 in 20.\\nEven so, Dr Will believes that Mr Warhurst\\'s disease was a coincidence not\\nrelated to BSE exposure. His study has shown no change in the pattern of CJD\\nsince BSE started and no other cases among people working with cattle, such\\nas abattoir staff or vets.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nWhile some Democrats claim term limits are a \"right-wing\" crusade, this author (John Fund) believes support from the liberal and Democratic sphere is increasing. Polls show Americans back term limits by 75% to 21% nationwide. One reason is that term limits would open up politics to people--minorities and women--now excluded from office. Some past Democratic leaders were cited as supporting the idea, but the party \"apparatchiks\" remain against it. Some journalists favor term limits voicing a need for new blood and the end of professional politicians. Fund does not believe enacting term limits will be easy.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nHouse Speaker Tom Foley charges that most of the support\\nfor the term limit proposal in Washington state came from\\n\"extreme right-wing activists.\" Ron Brown, chairman of the\\nDemocratic National Committee, says \"term limits are a\\nbackhanded attempt by Republicans to get rid of Democrats\\nthey can\\'t defeat at the polls.\" Are term limits a crusade\\ndriven by only one party or ideology? While it\\'s true the\\nmost visible term limit advocates are right of center, the\\nmovement is picking up many prominent liberal and Democratic\\nsupporters.\\n\\nCertainly the polls show that term limits are\\noverwhelmingly popular with Americans regardless of income,\\nparty, race or sex. Last month\\'s Wall Street Journal/NBC News\\npoll showed Americans back term limits by 75% to 21%\\nnationwide. Those earning less than $20,000 a year supported\\nterm limits by 77% to 16%. Democrats and blacks both gave\\nterm limits 71% support. Women favored term limits more than\\nmen. Martin Plissner, political director for CBS News, says\\nhe has \"never seen an issue on which there was so little\\ndemographic variation.\"\\n\\nOne reason is that term limits would open up politics to\\nmany people now excluded from office by career incumbents.\\nThese include blacks, other minorities, and women. Most of\\nthe authors of Washington state\\'s term limit are liberal\\nDemocrats who want to break up \"the old-boy network.\" One of\\nthe authors, Sherry Bockwinkel, says \"You won\\'t see white\\nincumbents hanging on to districts that long ago became\\nlargely minority.\"\\n\\n\"Incumbency is the glass ceiling of American politics,\"\\nsays Kay Slaughter, the Democratic candidate in a special\\nU.S. House election in Virginia yesterday. She thinks term\\nlimits will give women more opportunities in politics; her\\nGOP opponent refused to support federal term limits. Former\\nRep. Shirley Chisholm, who in 1972 was the first black to run\\nfor a majorparty presidential nomination, says \"longterm\\nincumbency is a big reason that Congress no longer works and\\nisn\\'t representative. We need a lot more turnover.\" Colorado\\nRep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, the only American Indian in\\nCongress, backed a term limit measure last year that\\nrestricted his own tenure.\\n\\nTerm limits for Congress have been supported by some of\\nhistory\\'s most prominent Democrats. Harry Truman and John F.\\nKennedy both endorsed the idea while they were president.\\n\\nToday, former California Governor Jerry Brown says\\nadvocacy of term limits is a key element in his populist\\npresidential campaign against a \"constipated\" political\\nsystem. \"Term limits are a castor oil that democracy needs to\\ntake,\" he says. Last year, as head of the California\\nDemocratic Party he refused to sign a party slate mailer\\nagainst term limits. \"I saw incumbents spend their time\\nfund-raising and worrying about how to stay in office. It\\'s\\ntime more candidates thought of politics as a calling instead\\nof a career.\"\\n\\nMr. Brown says arguments that legislative staff and the\\nunelected bureaucracy would gain power under term limits are\\nsimply proof that \"we must curb the excessive power of those\\npolitical players as well.\" He notes both groups opposed term\\nlimits in his home state; the California initiative included\\nbudget cuts that retired more than 700 legislative staffers.\\n\\nOther former Democratic governors who favor term limits\\ninclude Vermont\\'s Madeleine Kunin and Colorado\\'s RichardLamm.\\n\"Breaking the gridlock of incumbency could throw the doors\\nopen to new people and new ideas that would make politics\\nrewarding, meaningful and fun,\" says Ms. Kunin. \"The system\\nneeds a kick in the rear,\" says Mr. Lamm. \"Term limits have\\nflaws, but they will provide badly needed competition.\"\\n\\nWhile many prominent Democrats support term limits, party\\n\"apparatchiks\" are dead set against them. The Democratic\\nCongressional Campaign Committee has quietly put out the word\\nthat it will blacklist political consultants who advise\\ncandidates to back term limits and has told pollsters not to\\nask term-limit questions.\\n\\nIntimidation like that has slowed support for term limits\\namong Democratic officeholders, but there are exceptions. In\\nMassachusetts, the state\\'s Democratic attorney general and\\nsecretary of state both favor term limits. In Texas, Gov. Ann\\nRichards says she \"would be glad\" to sign a bill limiting\\ncongressional and legislative terms. Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock\\nalso leans in favor of term limits.\\n\\nJournalists are under fewer constraints than elected\\nofficials in expressing enthusiasm for term limits. Among\\nthose who have, and who will never be accused of being\\ncard-carrying Republicans, are: Washington Post columnist\\nRichard Cohen, syndicated columnist Richard Reeves, the\\nNational Journal\\'s Neal Peirce and Time magazine\\'s Michael\\nKramer.\\n\\nHendrik Hertzberg, a former speechwriter for Jimmy Carter\\nwho edited the New Republic until last month, agrees term\\nlimits would mean a loss of some distinguished legislators.\\nHowever, he concludes \"it would be a cost worth paying to be\\nrid of the much larger number of time-servers who have\\nlearned nothing from longevity in office except cynicism,\\ncomplacency and a sense of diminished possibility.\" Columnist\\nEllen Goodman says \"We have to learn once again that ideal\\npublic service is, by definition, temporary.\" She thinks the\\ncurrent Congress proves \"the politically privileged class has\\nbecome more isolated than experienced.\"\\n\\nSuch recent body-blows to Congress as Kitegate and the\\nClarence Thomas hearings have convinced some liberal media\\noutlets to reevaluate term limits. The liberal Seattle Times,\\nWashington state\\'s largest newspaper, stunned its readers by\\nendorsing term limits. WCVB-TV, the ABC affiliate in Boston,\\nhas often had its liberal editorials called \"the Boston Globe\\nof the airwaves.\" In April, it denounced term limits as \"the\\nlatest anti-government fad to sweep the country.\" Last month,\\nthe station made a highly unusual about-face and endorsed\\nterm limits for Congress: \"We\\'re not going to get\\n{leadership} till we have a massive infusion of new blood.\"\\n\\nAmong Democratic Party activists, James Calaway of Texas\\nis typical of those who now favor term limits. Currently the\\nnational treasurer for the American Civil Liberties Union,\\nMr. Calaway was also chairman of the national Democratic\\nParty\\'s $15 million \"Victory Fund\" in 1988. He says term\\nlimits would mean \"we\\'re governed by citizens who go home\\nafter their service and not permanent, elitist people who\\nnever leave office.\" Other Texas Democrats who have joined\\nhim include Frances \"Sissy\" Farenthold, who cochaired George\\nMcGovern\\'s 1972 national campaign, and Leonel Castillo, Jimmy\\nCarter\\'s director of the Immigration and Naturalization\\nService.\\n\\nNeo-liberals, who believe that centralized bureaucracies\\nare the biggest obstacle to reforming government, are also\\nwarming to term limits. David Osborne, who became sort of a\\nguru for neo-liberals with his book \"Laboratories of\\nDemocracy,\" speaks for many reform-minded liberals when he\\nsays, \"Term limits are necessary to shake things up and\\ndisrupt the careerist mindset that leads to so much cowardice\\nin elected officials.\"\\n\\nWhile Speaker Tom Foley reacts to term limits the way that\\nLinus in the comic strip \"Peanuts\" would if his security\\nblanket were taken away, some House Democrats think his\\nconcern that term limits would result in large GOP gains in\\nCongress is a fantasy. \"People who say term limits are a\\nRepublican plot to oust incumbents should know that a\\nmajority of open seats are won by Democrats,\" says Rep. Andy\\nJacobs of Indiana. Indeed, the Democratic Party could\\nactually be helped by term limits, according to former\\nOklahoma state legislator Cleta Mitchell, a self-described\\n\"liberal feminist\" who works with the Denver-based term limit\\ngroup Americans Back in Charge. \"Democrats must offer voters\\nmore than the simple powers of incumbency,\" she says. \"So\\nlong as our party is dominated by cynical veterans it will\\nturn off the young people who are our party\\'s future.\"\\n\\nNo one suggests the drive to enact term limits will be\\neasy -- especially in states that ban voter initiatives. But\\nthere are already signs that business lobbies, labor unions\\nand other term limit opponents are relying more on convincing\\njudges -- starting with Florida\\'s heavily politicized state\\nSupreme Court -- to overturn state term limits than on trying\\nto convince voters to reject the idea. The leading anti-term\\nlimit group, Let the People Decide, has closed its\\nWashington, D.C., offices and been reduced to a skeleton\\nstaff.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nPresident Clinton chose William Daley, son of legendary Chicago political boss Richard Daley, to head a task force to get NAFTA ratified. Smooth-talking Daley has important connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organized labor. He is experienced at the back-room political arm-twisting required to sway moderate Democrats in a divided Congress. Recent polls show 2/3 of Americans oppose NAFTA. Grassroots opposition fueled by labor groups is growing. Clinton reserved his own support until environmental and labor side agreements were reached. The agreement will unravel if it is not ratified by Jan 1. The battle for congressional support will be fierce.\\nIntroduction:\\nTHE MAN President Bill Clinton has chosen to head the task force to help get\\nhis free trade pact with Canada and Mexico ratified may lack experience in\\ninternational trade arenas. But he comes to Washington well prepared for the\\nkind of back-room political arm-twisting that will be required to persuade a\\ndivided Congress to pass it.\\nWilliam Daley is younger brother and chief adviser to Chicago\\'s mayor\\nRichard M Daley and offspring of the legendary Democratic machine \\'Boss\\',\\nthe late Richard J Daley. Unlike his hot-tempered and very public brother,\\n45-year-old Bill Daley is a smooth-talking behind-the-scenes operator with\\nimportant connections in Washington and long-standing ties with organised\\nlabour. He has never run for political office.\\nMr Daley accepted the Nafta position after being passed over for a cabinet\\nposition and turning down an offer to be Mr Clinton\\'s chief negotiator at\\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva.\\nHe chaired Mr Clinton\\'s election campaign in Illinois, where he delivered 48\\nper cent of the vote to Clinton, above the national average, and continues\\nas a tangible supporter. Most recently, he arranged a posh Chicago dinner\\nfor the president that raised Dollars 1m (Pounds 670,000).\\nHowever, Mr Daley\\'s appointment to chair the White House\\'s task force on the\\nNorth America Free Trade Agreement is not a cosy political payoff. Recent\\npolls show that as many as two-thirds of the American people do not support\\nNafta, and grassroots opposition fuelled by labour groups is growing.\\nMr Clinton himself reserved his support for the deal, negotiated under\\nGeorge Bush\\'s administration, until side agreements dealing with\\nenvironmental and labour issues were reached last month. Many Democrats in\\nCongress, including some in the powerful Illinois delegation, are\\nuncommitted. With the agreement fated to unravel if it is not ratified by\\nJanuary 1, the battle for congressional support will be fierce, fast, and\\nvisible.\\nMr Daley was chosen for the job, Chicago observers say, because he has\\nproven he can sway votes and is willing to take the risk of losing a\\ncontroversial battle. \\'Bill Daley is no Washington neophyte. Clinton needs\\nsomeone with political sense to move this thing through Congress, and Daley\\nhas the connections,\\' says a fellow Washington lobbyist.\\nOpposition to Nafta comes from core Democratic constituencies, making it a\\npotential political pothole for Mr Clinton. Mr Daley\\'s talents have been\\nsummoned, insiders say, to convince moderate Democrats to back the\\nagreement.\\nThe president needs 218 votes in the House to ratify Nafta. The\\nadministration counts 125 Republicans in favour of the agreement. Clinton\\nally and fellow Chicago Democrat, Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House\\nways and means committee, is expected to deliver the 20 Democrats on his\\ncommittee. However, Mr Rostenkowski is under investigation for improper use\\nof his post office perks and faces an uneasy future.\\nBy rough count, Mr Daley will have to marshall 73 votes from Democratic\\nrepresentatives of states standing to gain the most from the agreement:\\nthose along the border with Mexico and those with big agricultural, consumer\\nproduct, or manufacturing export interests.\\nHis Chicago-style back-room muscle will be an invisible counterweight to the\\npublic tactics of Nafta\\'s most prominent opponent, Mr Ross Perot. Mr Perot\\'s\\npopulist anti-Nafta campaign touts the \\'giant sucking sound\\' that will be\\nheard as Nafta-loosened jobs flow south of the Texas border.\\n\\'It is a very interesting juxtaposition of styles,\\' says Chicago political\\ncommentator Mr Bruce DuMont. \\'Bill Daley is like a Stealth bomber. You may\\nnot see him, but you\\'ll see the results.\\'\\nMr Daley has taken four months out from his Chicago law firm to lead the\\nNafta push. He recently rejoined the firm after a three-year stint as\\npresident of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, which was founded by the\\nAmalgamated Textile Workers union in 1922. Although it passed into private\\nownership in 1966, its board is still dominated by high-profile union\\nofficials.\\nMr Clinton may be banking on Mr Daley\\'s union ties to help the Nafta effort.\\nHowever, Mr Daley, by pushing Nafta, runs the risk of alienating his union\\nsupporters. Mr Jim Jontz, former congressman from Indiana and director of\\nthe anti-Nafta Citizen\\'s Trade Campaign, said: \\'I don\\'t know why Bill Daley\\nwould want to be in a position like that. It\\'s just wrong.\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAn unqualified mate was piloting the Exxon Valdez when it crashed into rocks resulting in the worst oil spill in US history. The Long Beach-bound tanker was actually involved in two separate accidents, first hitting a jagged rock pinnacle a mile outside shipping lanes, then after going two more miles, hit more underwater rocks. Exxon did not know if Captain Hazelwood took the wheel before the second accident. Mate Gregory Cousins did not have Coast Guard certification to pilot through the Sound. The International Bird Rescue Center set up a rehabilitation center and experts from the Hubbs Marine Research Institute in San Diego were to arrive today.\\nIntroduction:\\nAn unqualified mate was piloting the Exxon Valdez -- violating both Coast Guard \\nregulations and company policy -- when the tanker crashed into rocks, \\nunleashing the worst oil spill in U.S. history, Exxon Shipping Co. said Sunday. \\n\\nExxon also disclosed that the Long Beach-bound tanker actually was involved in \\ntwo separate accidents that night in pristine Prince William Sound. \\n\\nMeanwhile, winds kicked up around the crippled ship, stirring fears that choppy \\nwaters could destabilize the Exxon Valdez and sweep the slick ashore. \\n\\nWildlife experts were summoned from California to coordinate any efforts to \\nrescue birds and sea otters, whose feathers and fur make them the most \\nvulnerable to oil contamination. \\n\\n\\nOil-Covered Birds, Otters \\n\\nBiologists already have counted 95 birds and two otters covered with oil but \\nwere unable to capture them for cleaning. \\n\\nKiller whales, sea lions and ducks also have been spotted swimming in the muck. \\n\\nCleanup efforts continued slowly, and Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper declared Prince \\nWilliam Sound a disaster area, freeing state resources for cleanup and paving \\nthe way for a federal disaster declaration. \\n\\nMany questions about the disaster remained unanswered. \\n\\nStill unexplained is why Third Mate Gregory Cousins was steering the 987-foot \\nvessel through the tricky, iceberg-dotted waters on Friday. \\n\\nFrank Iarossi, president of Exxon Shipping, told reporters that Capt. Joseph \\nHazelwood was one flight below the bridge in his cabin when the Exxon Valdez \\nhit the first jagged rock pinnacle about a mile outside shipping lanes. \\n\\nThe ship then \"slid about two miles\" under full power and hit more underwater \\nrocks, Iarossi said. At no time did the ship lose steering, he added. \\n\\nIarossi said he did not know whether Hazelwood took the wheel after the first \\naccident, or how much time elapsed between the two incidents. \\n\\nThere would have been no reason for the 42-year-old captain to go below to use \\nthe bathroom or get coffee, since both are available on the bridge, Iarossi \\nsaid. \\n\\n\"I agree something is missing,\" Iarossi told reporters and local residents at a \\npress conference. \\n\\nCousins, a three-year employee of Exxon, did not have the Coast Guard \\ncertification required to pilot through the sound but was qualified under other \\ncircumstances to steer the ship, Iarossi said. \\n\\n\\nPuts Off Filing Charges \\n\\n\"We\\'re not going to file any charges until we are done with our investigation,\" \\nsaid Coast Guard spokesman Todd Nelson. \\n\\n\"The Coast Guard may seem slow and plodding at times, but if we file charges, \\nwe\\'re going to make them stick,\" he added. \\n\\nNelson said piloting a ship without proper certification is a civil, not \\ncriminal, violation, which ultimately could result in suspension or revocation \\nof the captain\\'s license. \\n\\nExxon has not made any of the Exxon Valdez\\'s 20 crew members available for \\ninterviews. \\n\\nThe Coast Guard served subpoenas Saturday on the captain, helmsman and third \\nmate to ensure that they make themselves available to investigators. \\n\\nA team from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived Sunday to probe \\nthe cause of the accident. \\n\\nExperts from the International Bird Rescue Center in Berkeley, Calif., set up a \\nrehabilitation center here Sunday in case oiled birds are captured. Otter \\nexperts from Hubbs Marine Research Institute at Sea World in San Diego were due \\nto arrive today. \\n\\nBut even if animals turn up in distress, rescues may not be feasible. \\n\\n\"Human life and safety is more important,\" said Pamela Bergmann, the Department \\nof the Interior representative assessing the situation. \\n\\nShe said it might be too perilous to try to capture panicky birds and otters \\nfrom boats in the frigid water, and there is no road access to the shores where \\nthey are likely to show up. \\n\\nA monitor from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said he felt encouraged about \\nimpact on the area\\'s abundant marine life after patrolling the 50-square-mile \\nslick by boat Saturday. \\n\\n\"The reason we haven\\'t seen a large number of birds affected so far is that the \\noil is out in the middle of the sound,\" said Everett Robinson-Wilson, the \\nagency\\'s environmental contaminant coordinator. \\n\\n\"The weather will help us or kill us,\" he added. \\n\\nWinds of up to 35 m.p.h. were expected by today. \\n\\nNeither Exxon nor the state and federal agencies involved in the operation \\ncould say how much oil had been mopped up or what percentage of the slick is \\ncontained. \\n\\nThe Exxon Valdez spewed about 250,000 barrels of North Slope crude into the \\nice-blue waters. Another 1 million barrels remain aboard the damaged ship, but \\nno new leakage has been reported. \\n\\nPumps were being used to siphon the remaining oil into a sister tanker Sunday, \\nan operation expected to take up to a week. \\n\\nSalvagers hope the two-year-old Exxon Valdez will be able to float free once \\nits load is lightened. \\n\\n\\nUp to $20 Million Damages \\n\\nIarossi estimated damage to the $125-million ship at $10 million to $20 \\nmillion. \\n\\nVideotapes filmed by divers revealed 10 sizable holes in the ship\\'s hull, \\nranging from 8 feet by 15 feet to 20 feet by 6 feet, Iarossi said. \\n\\n\\nRocks Charted \\n\\nHe indicated that the rocks the ship hit were charted and well within range of \\nthe Exxon Valdez\\'s navigational equipment. \\n\\nNo disciplinary action has been taken against any crew members, Iarossi said. \\nThe executive promised to make public results of mandatory drug and alcohol \\ntests on crew members. \\n\\nSo far, oil has washed ashore only on two tiny islands in the sound, and beach \\ncleanup efforts were under way. \\n\\n\\nHasn\\'t Seen Plan \\n\\n\"We have been told by Exxon that they will come up with an organized cleanup \\nplan, but we\\'ve yet to see one,\" said Barbara Holian, spokeswoman for the state \\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation. \\n\\nThe agency is studying its \"legal options\" and may ask the Coast Guard to take \\nover the cleanup from Exxon, she said. \\n\\nAt Coast Guard offices here, Nelson said such a move was unlikely. \\n\\n\"The Coast Guard doesn\\'t have tons and tons of its own equipment, and it would \\nhave to hire the same people Exxon has,\" Nelson said. \"That would just slow \\nthings down. \\n\\n\"Right now, Exxon is the oil company with the deep pockets, and it\\'s cleaning \\nup its own spill within federal guidelines.\" \\n\\n\\nRANKING THE EXXON VALDEZ SPILL \\n\\n11 million gallons that have leaked so far from the Exxon Valdez are dwarfed by \\nsome of the record spills around the world: \\n\\n<TABLE CWL=\"4.09IN:2.66IN:2.11IN:2.99IN\" WDM=\"ABS\" NCOLS=\"4\">\\n<ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE>\\n<TABLEROW>\\n<CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE>\\n<TABLECELL CHJ=\"C\"

The wreckage was found after a six day search in poor weather. U.S. Army search helicopters had to lower men to the ground at the site, since there was no landing area on the mountainside, where the grade is 60%. The plane was carrying Representative Mickey Leland of Texas to an Ethiopian refugee camp, one of several he was touring as Chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, which he helped to establish. Other government officials were aboard. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\\nIntroduction:\\nU.S. military helicopters on Sunday located the wreckage of a plane that \\ncrashed last Monday with Texas congressman Mickey Leland and 15 others aboard. \\nWitnesses who visited the site said there were no survivors. \\n\\nU.S. rescue and recovery teams said that the plane hit a mountain about 4,300 \\nfeet above sea level, having missed clearing the peak by about 300 feet. The \\ncrash site is about 75 miles east of the Fugnido refugee camp that Leland was \\nflying to visit when the plane vanished in heavy weather last Monday. \\n\\n\"If they would have flown over that peak they would have been home free,\" said \\nRep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.), a colleague of Leland\\'s who has accompanied \\nsearch crews for the last two days and was aboard the helicopter that first \\nspotted the wreckage Sunday. Ackerman said that the plane appeared to have hit \\n\"nose first, right into the rocks; its two wings sheared off, its engines \\nmelted, its fuselage gone.\" \\n\\n\\nWreckage Examined \\n\\nAckerman said that military paratroopers lowered themselves from his helicopter \\non ropes to examine the wreckage. \\n\\n\"They told us everyone had died instantaneously,\" Ackerman said. \\n\\nThe 44-year-old Leland, a Democrat, was making his sixth tour of refugee camps \\nalong the Ethiopia-Sudan border as chairman of the House Select Committee on \\nHunger, a panel he had helped to establish five years ago. \\n\\nAlso aboard the plane were Hugh Anderson Johnson Jr. and Patrice Yvonne \\nJohnson, both aides to Leland (who were not related); Joyce Francine Williams, \\nan aide to Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), and an expert on child \\nnutrition; Y. Ivan Tillen, a New York businessman and friend of Leland\\'s; \\nRobert Woods, a political and economic officer at the American Embassy in Addis \\nAbaba; Gladys Gilbert, a special projects officer for the mission of the U.S. \\nAgency for International Development attached to the embassy; Thomas Worrick, \\nthe acting AID representative in Ethiopia, and Worrick\\'s wife, Roberta. \\n\\n\\n7 Ethiopians Killed \\n\\nAlso on board were Debebe Agonofer, an Ethiopian agricultural economist with \\nthe AID mission, and six other Ethiopians, including the plane\\'s crew of three. \\n\\nReaction to the news in the United States was one of sadness coupled with an \\noutpouring of praise for Leland\\'s work. A statement issued by President Bush \\nsaid that \"Mickey Leland and the other members of his traveling party, both \\nAmericans and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause -- trying to feed the \\nhungry.\" \\n\\nDellums spoke of his staff aide who lost her life in the crash as \"a close \\npersonal friend for over a decade\" and said that everyone on the plane \"shared \\na common commitment to helping the poor, the starving and the dispossessed in \\nthat war-torn, drought-stricken land.\" \\n\\n\"Their deaths are a collective loss to all humanity,\" Dellums said. \\n\\nDiscovery of the crash site ended what had been one of the most extensive \\nAmerican search and rescue operations ever conducted in a Third World country. \\nBy Sunday, 18 aircraft, including four American helicopters, two American C-130 \\nairplanes and 12 Ethiopian aircraft, were involved in the search. Three more \\nAmerican helicopters were reported to be en route from Eglin Air Force Base in \\nFlorida when word of the discovery came. \\n\\nThe search on Sunday was hampered again by thunderstorms, poor visibility and \\nother conditions that characterized many of the previous days of search. \\n\\n\"The terrain was fairly rugged and the weather conditions were bad getting \\nthere,\" said Capt. Clair M. Gilk, commander of one of the two helicopters that \\nwere the first to spot the wreckage. \\n\\nGilk said that the crash site, in a mountainous and heavily wooded region, is \\nso remote and inaccessible that the nearest landing site for helicopters is \\nhalf a mile away, a distance that he said could take as much as three hours to \\ncover on foot. \\n\\n\\nRecovery Planned for Today \\n\\nAir Force personnel were assigned to remain near the site Sunday night to keep \\nit secure. Recovery of the remains of those aboard the plane, a twin-engine \\nTwin Otter, was to commence at first light today. \\n\\nBecause of the site\\'s inaccessibility, it could take at least two days to \\nrecover all of the bodies, according to Maj. Gen. James F. Record, who came \\nhere from Washington to oversee the search effort. Record arrived in Addis \\nAbaba about 10 minutes after the first reports were received of the sighting of \\nthe crash site. \\n\\nIn Washington, a Pentagon spokesman, Navy Capt. Stan Bloyer, said that the \\nremains of the Americans will probably be returned to the United States through \\nTorrejon Air Base near Madrid, where the American armed forces maintains full \\nmortuary facilities. \\n\\n\\nDellums to Accompany Bodies \\n\\nDellums, House Majority Whip William H. Gray III (D-Pa.) and Republican Reps. \\nBill Emerson of Missouri and Jack Fields of Texas plan to fly to Addis Ababa to \\naccompany the bodies back to the United States. \\n\\nDiscovery of the crash site came at about 1:15 p.m. local time Sunday. Ackerman \\nsaid that the helicopter he was traveling in set down during the morning at an \\nairstrip near the village of Dembi Dolo. There, the crew came upon a Roman \\nCatholic missionary who told them that he had heard reports from local \\nvillagers that a plane had been heard nearby last week. Presently, the crew \\nfound an Ethiopian surveyor who said he could guide them to an area near where \\nthe plane had been heard. The surveyor was taken aboard, crew members said, but \\non their way toward their destination they spotted the crash site. \\n\\nThe location was described as very steep, with the plane resting on land that \\nwas pitched at an angle of about 60 degrees. \\n\\n\\n\\'Mostly Rocks and Brush\\' \\n\\nCrew members described the site as \"mostly rocks and brush\" and indicated that \\nthe pilot of Leland\\'s plane may have been trying to escape bad weather on \\nMonday by following the pathway of a river flowing through a valley. Before the \\nplane reached safety, it ran into the mountainside. \\n\\nRep. Alan Wheat (D-Mo.), who with Ackerman had been flying with search crews \\nfor the last two days, said he telephoned House Speaker Thomas S. Foley \\n(D-Wash.) from Addis Ababa soon after the discovery was made. He said that \\nFoley was \"heartbroken\" at the news. \\n\\nThe crash site was described by U.S. authorities as being about 20 nautical \\nmiles due east of the town of Gambela and 230 nautical miles west-southwest of \\nAddis Ababa. It appeared to be near the village of Bure. \\n\\n\\nArea Had Been Covered \\n\\nThe area of the site had apparently been searched within the first two days \\nafter the crash by American aircraft using electronic devices in an attempt to \\ndetect an emergency signal from the downed craft. However, Sunday was the first \\nday that helicopters flew over the area to make visual inspections. \\n\\nThe discovery, and indications that the passengers had died instantly, brought \\nan end to charges that the American military response to the emergency was \\ninadequate and tardy. Wheat, who was among those who had pressed Defense \\nDepartment officials for the deployment of more aircraft in the search, said \\nafter the discovery Sunday: \"We could have brought every plane in the world \\nthat we have, and it would not have made a difference.\" \\n\\nPresident Bush, in his Sunday statement, said: \"I have known, admired and \\nworked with Mickey Leland for many years. His sense of compassion and desire to \\nhelp those in need has aided millions of people from Houston to Addis Ababa. \\nOur hearts go out to (his widow) and to the families and friends of the \\ncongressional staff members, State Department, Agency for International \\nDevelopment and Ethiopian officials who joined Mickey on his important mission \\nand who died with him trying to carry it out.\" \\n\\n\\n\\'Best in Compassion\\' \\n\\nFoley said that \"in his search to look into the plight of the world\\'s most \\ndesperate and hungry individuals, Rep. Leland represented the best in \\ncompassion that we as a nation possess.\" \\n\\nSecretary of State James A. Baker III praised the congressman as \"an \\noutstanding statesman and humanitarian who died serving his country.\" Baker \\nalso thanked Ethiopia, a Soviet-allied country with which Washington has had \\nstrained relations for several years, for its \"outstanding support\" in the \\nsearch for Leland\\'s party. \\n\\nBush offered U.S. help to the Ethiopian government for its investigation into \\nthe crash of the plane. \\n\\nLeland was a former Houston pharmacist who called the fight against hunger \"my \\npassion.\" He leaves a wife, Alison Walton Leland, and a 3-year-old son, \\nJarrett. Mrs. Leland is pregnant with the couple\\'s second child. \\n\\nFirst elected to Congress in 1978, he represented a mostly black and Hispanic \\nsection of Houston after the retirement of Rep. Barbara Jordan, a fellow \\nDemocrat. \\n\\nLeland had no significant opposition for his congressional seat since he was \\nfirst elected, winning his most recent election with 96% of the vote. \\n\\nTimes staff writer Melissa Healy, in Washington, contributed to this story. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nHealth Professionals and the Diabetes Society in California are presenting a program to educate Hispanics in healthy food preparation and diabetes prevention. Food preparation, specifically frying of foods in saturated fats, are believed to be one cause of the obesity problem that often leads to diabetes. Other factors stressed are nutrition, spacing of food intake throughout the day, and exercise. This is the first time education has centered on prevention of the disease. Educators in California and other heavily Hispanic areas are learning that cultural factors are highly important in combating the alarming rise of diabetes among this population.\\nIntroduction:\\nYou can have your tamale and eat it too, says Rachel Torres, diabetes educator\\nat San Jose Hospital and coordinator of the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara\\nValley\\'s Hispanic Education Program.\\nThe secret to eating Mexican and\\nother Hispanic foods while still maintaining a healthy diet is in the\\npreparation of the food, she said.  \\n\\nBeginning this summer, Torres and other health professionals will be\\noffering nutrition and exercise classes geared toward Hispanics in an effort\\nto educate them on the dangers of diabetes.\\nAccording to state Health\\nDepartment statistics, the incidence of diabetes in the Hispanic population is\\nthree times that of the general population. Health experts believe the\\nHispanic diet and genetic predisposition may be contributing factors.\\n\"Our\\nfood is one of the richest in terms of taste and nutrition,\" said Torres. \"But\\nit\\'s the way we prepare the food that messes things up for us.\"\\nIn her\\nclasses, Torres said she will instruct her students to prepare tamales,\\nrefried beans and other traditional Hispanic dishes using polyunsaturated oil\\nrather than the more traditional recipes that call for the use of lard. And\\ninstead of eating four tortillas at one sitting, she recommends they be eaten\\nthroughout the day.\\nAlthough courses for Hispanic diabetics and their\\nfamilies have been offered by the Diabetic Society for almost three years,\\nlessons on the benefits of good nutrition and exercise to combat the disease\\nwill be offered for the first time.\\nSue Ann Kelly, education director for\\nthe Diabetes Society, said the classes may be the first ones ever geared\\nspecifically toward the Hispanic lifestyle.\\n\"It\\'s a powerful feeling our\\neducators get when they discover all the cultural issues that come in to play\\nwhen dealing with diabetes,\" she said.\\nIF YOU\\'RE INTERESTED; The next course\\nfor Hispanic diabetics and their families will be 9 a.m. to noon Saturday at\\nAlexian Brother\\'s Hospital, 225 N. Jackson Ave. Registration will begin at\\n8:30 a.m. Classes are free. For more information, call (408) 287-3785. For\\nthose who can\\'t make it to class, the Diabetes Society of Santa Clara County\\noffers the bilingual booklet, \"Comer Bien Para Vivir Mejor,\" a seven-day\\nMexican food menu for diabetics as well as those who want to eat healthy.  \\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThousands more acres of brush and timber went up in smoke Saturday in seven states in the West, threatening homes in some places. Fire crews were at work in Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, California and Washington. Elsewhere, four big fires burned in interior Alaska, one having charred an estimated 24,000 acres. A fire in Georgia\\'s Okefenoke swamp that burned 500 acres of habitat for an endangered species of woodpecker was reported under control. The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho listed 7,000 to 7,500 people on the fire lines.

That was Denver\\'s fifth\\nconsecutive day at 100 degrees or higher.\\n   Fire crews were at work in Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,\\nArizona, California and Washington. Elsewhere, four big fires burned\\nin interior Alaska, one having charred an estimated 24,000 acres. A\\nfire in Georgia\\'s Okefenoke swamp that burned 500 acres of habitat\\nfor an endangered species of woodpecker was reported contained\\nSaturday.\\n   The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates\\nfederal firefighting efforts, listed 7,000 to 7,500 people on the\\nfire lines, along with 42 air tankers, 14 guide planes and 10\\nhelicopters, spokesman Arnold Hartigan said Saturday.\\n   So far this fire season, the agency has had 31,000 fires\\nreported, which have burned 1,117,000 acres. In the same period last\\nyear, it had 54,000 fires but 765,000 acres burned.\\n   The fact that there are more acres burned this year, but fewer\\nfires, ``means this year\\'s fires are in very rugged, inaccessible\\nterrain, which makes them hard to fight,\\'\\' said Hartigan. ``Also,\\nsome of them are in areas where there have not been any fires for\\nyears, and that means there is excellent fuel available.\\'\\'\\n   The largest fire in the Lower 48 states was the week-old Diamond\\nPeak fire in Utah, which had burned 12,200 acres of forest and brush\\nin an area 20 miles west of the Utah-Colorado border, just north of\\nInterstate 70.\\n   It was 80 percent contained, but after a week of temperatures\\naround 100 degrees, the National Weather Service predicted possible\\ndry lightning storms and gusting wind.\\n   Elsewhere in Utah, the Uinta Canyon fire had burned 3,850 acres\\n20 miles north of Roosevelt in the Ashley National Forest. Forest\\nService spokeswoman Cece Stewart said three helicopters scattered\\nincendiary bombs made of chemically treated plastic balls on an\\nunburned 200-acre area between fire lines and the main fire in an\\neffort to stop the fire\\'s advance.\\n   High wind also was expected in northern California, where a\\n2,500-acre fire near Janesville on the eastern slopes of the Sierra\\nNevada destroyed two mobile homes. U.S. 395 between Milford and\\nJanesville was closed.\\n   ``The wind was pretty brisk. It just blew the fire and pushed it\\nout,\\'\\' said Forest Service spokesman Dave Reider.\\n   Relentless winds first pushed the fire north, then south,\\nprompting Sheriff Ron Jarrel to order the evacuation of a sparsely\\npopulated area about a mile south of the fire line, Reider said. It\\nwas unknown how many people were affected.\\n   Spokesman Larry Lathrop said a helicopter battling the fire\\ncrashed Saturday about four miles southeast of Janesville.\\n   Lathrop said the pilot walked away from the crash, but the\\nhelicopter was destroyed. The chopper apparently was making a water\\ndrop when it crashed.\\n   In the Sierra foothills near Oroville, north of Sacramento, a\\n750-acre fire was contained Saturday after burning four homes, six\\noutbuildings and six vehicles, and forcing about 150 residents to\\nflee briefly Friday night, according to the California Department of\\nForestry.\\n   Firefighters gained the upper hand on a trio of forest fires in\\nColorado\\'s drought-stricken mountains Saturday, but a new blaze of\\nan estimated 3,000 acres in grass and timber on the eastern plains\\nhad crews scrambling to protect a subdivision in Elbert County.\\n   Residents of nine homes in the subdivision about 25 miles\\nnortheast of Kiowa were evacuated Friday night, but later were\\nallowed to return home.\\n   In the Bridger-Teton National Forest in western Wyoming, a fire\\nhad grown to 3,420 acres, burning an additional 1,000 acres in 24\\nhours, according to forest officials. Forest spokesman Ed Christian\\nsaid the fire was about 50 percent contained by Saturday night and\\nthat with some cooperation from the weather, crews should be able to\\ncomplete their containment line by Monday.\\n   Officials in Arizona gave priority to the Marijilda fire, which\\nhad blackened 2,500 acres of forest on the north side of Mount\\nGraham near Safford, and the Chiva fire east of Tucson, which had\\nburned 8,300 acres in the Rincon Mountains, according to BLM\\nspokesman Wendell Peacock.\\n   Arizona\\'s largest fire until Saturday, in the Peloncillo\\nMountains south of Duncan, along the Arizona-New Mexico border, had\\ncharred 8,000 acres but was 80 percent contained.\\n   Firefighters spent an eighth day Saturday battling the\\nlightning-caused, 8,139-acre Divide fire 50 miles northeast of\\nSilver City in the Gila National Forest in southwestern New Mexico,\\nU.S. Forest Service officials said.\\n   Firefighters in north-central Washington encircled a 4,500-acre\\nrange fire early Saturday.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe president of Brazil blames the industrial nations for perpetuating the poverty of the developing nations. In West Berlin, the finance ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded action to help Third World countries with their 1.2 trillion dollar debt. Brazil, the world\\'s most indebted nation with 121 billion in foreign loans, has been among the most vociferous lobbyists for debt restructuring and write-offs. There is an imbalance in trade. One group is selling its wares cheaply and buying those of others dearly. The seven key industrialized nations have approved a plan to aid the world\\'s poorest countries.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Third World countries led by Brazil, the\\nworld\\'s most indebted developing nation, blamed the industrialized\\nnations in part Monday for perpetuating their poverty.\\n   Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreau Sodre of Brazil told the\\nopening session of the 42nd General Assembly that the Third World\\neconomic picture was dimming ``due to the lack of progress in\\ninternational economic relations.\\'\\'\\n   ``It is ... sad to note that we, American, Asian, African\\nbrothers, still suffer from the same horrors and the same\\ndesolation which so badly affected our forebears,\\'\\' he said,\\nadding, ``hunger ... is endemically spreading throughout the\\ncontinents.\\'\\'\\n   A similar theme sounded Monday in West Berlin, where finance\\nministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded ``more\\nforceful action\\'\\' to help Third World countries repay $1.2 trillion\\nin debts.\\n   Brazil, with $121 billion in foreign loans, has been among the\\nstrongest Third World lobbyists for debt restructuring and\\nwriteoffs. It signed a comprehensive rescheduling agrement last\\nweek with its Western creditors.\\n   It is critical of the U.S. view that strong economic performance\\nin developed countries would trickle down to help the Third World.\\n   Foreign Affairs Secretary Obed Y. Asamoah of Ghana appealed to\\ncreditors to write off some debts and reschedule others. He urged\\nnations to work together to raise commodity prices to strengthen\\nAfrican economies.\\n   ``In a market place where one group of operators is continually\\nselling its wares cheaply and buying those of others dearly,\\nprotection needs be given to the weak and vulnerable operators,\\'\\'\\nhe said.

While meteorologists often blame such droughts on the jet stream being north of its usual position, this is not the cause. In April-June 1988, there were alternating high and low pressure centers across the northern Western Hemisphere preventing the normal flow of weather systems. Computer modeling suggests that these centers were related to unusual ocean temperature variations observed in the Pacific. If valid, monitoring ocean temperature may provide forewarning of droughts.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Some of this year\\'s drought in the Midwest may\\nhave been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equator\\nin the Pacific Ocean, according to a new computer study reported\\nThursday.\\n   Such droughts could be anticipated if the temperature\\nabnormalities turn out to be predictable, one of the authors said in\\nthe report appearing in Friday\\'s issue of Science magazine.\\n   The authors are Kevin E.

Arkin of the Climate Analysis Center of the National\\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Camp Springs, Md.\\n   They noted that when asked what caused the drought that hit much\\nof North America in 1988, meteorologists often reply ``the jet\\nstream was displaced northward of its usual position so that storms,\\nwhich tend to track along the path of the jet stream, were similarly\\ndisplaced northward.\\'\\'\\n   ``Such an answer is, however, just a brief description of the\\nweather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at the\\ncause. A more satisfying response would address why the jet stream\\nwas displaced northward,\\'\\' the team wrote.\\n   Their proposed answer focuses on the development in April, May\\nand June of drought in the Midwest, where several states recorded\\nless rain than at any time since 1895. By July the weather pattern\\nthey studied was breaking up, and continuing dryness in the study\\narea and elsewhere probably had other causes, Arkin said.\\n   But during the April-June period there were alternating high and\\nlow pressure centers across much of the northern half of the Western\\nHemisphere: A high-pressure center north of Hawaii, a low in the\\nGulf of Alaska, a high in central Canada extending down into the\\nnorthern Great Plains states and a low on the East Coast.\\n   In this period, Pacific Ocean temperatures ranged up to 5.4\\ndegrees Fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about\\n4,000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of South\\nAmerica, with the coolest spot midway along the band.\\n   At the same time, a bit to the north of this band, surface\\ntemperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal.\\n   When this temperature pattern was fed into the computer, the\\npattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems was\\nreproduced. The below-normal equatorial temperature by itself did\\nnot give such a result.\\n   ``We haven\\'t proved anything; all we\\'ve done is shown that it\\'s a\\npossibility,\\'\\' Arkin said.\\n   The global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of\\na more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these\\nabnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought, he\\nsaid.\\n   If the model holds up, the work will be the first demonstration\\nof tropical sea surface temperatures affecting weather outside the\\ntropics in the summer, Arkin said.\\n   The authors took note of computer models predicting increased\\nfrequency of drought with the buildup of the ``greenhouse effect\\'\\'\\nglobal warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide\\nin the atmosphere.\\n   ``The greenhouse effect may tilt the balance such that conditions\\nfor droughts and heat waves are more likely, but it cannot be blamed\\nfor an individual drought,\\'\\' they said.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAt the Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, strategists and quartermasters direct the nation\\'s wildfire battles.

The paper contended that it wanted to provide Peruvians with peace proposal information, not released by the government. The government had released letters from Guzman calling for peace talks in October 1993, claiming they represented an admission of political defeat and the government now had the initiative in confronting the guerrillas. Media in Lima doubt these conclusions, claiming Guzman is no longer in control and is being used by Fujimori.\\nIntroduction:\\nSUMMARY \\n                             A lengthy statement attributed to the imprisoned Shining Path \\nleadership, published recently in a leading opposition newspaper, \\nprovides what appears to be a strategic rationale for the peace \\nproposal made by the insurgents last fall.  While the newspaper \\nhas accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the \\nShining Path, the paper has also stressed that the peace called \\nfor in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical \\nretreat by the Shining Path leaders and is not, as President \\nAlberto Fujimori has contended, an implicit admission of defeat. \\n                         END SUMMARY \\n   Although La Republica, a prominent anti-Fujimori daily, provided \\nlittle information on the origins of the \"important and unusual\" \\ndocument that it published in a special 25 January supplement, it \\nassured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining \\nthe Shining Path\\'s \"struggle for a peace agreement\" was a genuine \\nShining Path statement.  The paper claimed that the \"anonymous \\nsources\" who supplied the \"secret\" document provided \"full \\nauthentication\" and that \"experts\" consulted by the paper also \\n\"agreed\" that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned \\nShining Path leader Abimael Guzman (La Republica, 26 \\nJanuary).(See Note 1) \\n   (Note 1) La Republica did not assert that the document was \\nactually signed by Guzman.  However, the paper did claim that the \\ndocument was \"approved\" by imprisoned Shining Path Central \\nCommittee members Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo, Osman Morote \\nBarrionuevo, Marta Huatay Ruiz, Maria Pantoja Sanchez and Rosa \\nAngelica Salas de la Cruz (25 January). \\n   While the anti-Fujimori daily may have, at least in part, \\npublished the document to discredit President Fujimori, it \\ncontended that it was motivated by a desire to provide Peruvians \\nwith information on the peace proposal that had not been made \\navailable by the government.  The paper declared that it was \\n\"clearly\" its \"duty\" to publish the document \"given the mantle of \\nsilence that the government has cast\" over the peace negotiations \\n(26 January). \\n   La Republica\\'s publication of the Shining Path strategy statement \\nfollows by three months the October 1993 release by the Fujimori \\ngovernment of letters from Guzman calling for peace talks with \\nthe government (Radio Programs del Peru, 1 October 1993; Radio \\nand TV, 4 October 1993; Global de Television, 10 October 1993; \\nPanamericana Television, 30 October 1993).  The Shining Path \\nleadership\\'s sudden willingness to pursue peace talks with the \\ngovernment, just as the 31 October national referendum vote was \\napproaching, raised questions in the media about whether the \\nletters really represented authoritative Shining Path policy [see \\nbox].(See Note 2) \\n   (Note 2) Among other objectives, the narrowly successful \\nreferendum was designed to allow the president to serve a second \\nsuccessive term. \\n   Tactical Retreat for Guzman \\n   Implicitly rejecting Fujimori\\'s claim that the Shining Path\\'s \\ncall for a negotiated peace represented an admission of political \\ndefeat by the insurgents, La Republica concluded that the \\nmovement\\'s leadership saw its call for peace as nothing more than \\na \"temporary ceasefire\" (25 January).(See Note 3)  According to \\nthe daily\\'s 26 January editorial, the Shining Path tract \"makes \\nit clear\" that in the eyes of Abimael Guzman a \"peace agreement\" \\nis simply an \"armed truce\" until after the year 2OOO, at which \\ntime the Shining Path \"would resume its bloodbath.\"  La Republica \\noffered a possible explanation for the insurgents\\' tactical \\nretreat in a 3O January interview with a \"military and subversion \\nanalyst,\" who suggested-that a temporary withdrawal may offer \\nGuzman an opportunity to preserve his authority as political \\nleader despite the obvious limitations of beings imprisoned.  Thee \\nanalyst concluded, therefore, that the insurgents\\' peace strategy \\nrepresents \"an ideological reaffirmation of Guzman\\'s leadership\" \\nand \"recognition that circumstances have changed.\" \\n   (Note 3) For example, in his presentation of the video recording \\nof Guzman\\'s first call for peace talks, Fujimori claimed that the \\nShining Path \"political\" leadership \"has tacitly admitted that \\nthe Peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in \\nconfronting the Shining Path\" (Lima Radio and TV, 4 October \\n1993). \\n   Outlook \\n   La Republica\\'s assessment of the Shining Path peace strategy \\ndocument may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling \\nfor peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders. \\nAt the same time, however, by concluding that the published \\nstrategy statement is merely the Shining Path\\'s declaration of \\ntemporary retreat, the daily has raised new questions about the \\ncredibility of Fujimori\\'s claim that the call for peace \\nrepresents a victory for the government.  While such doubts are \\nunlikely to seriously affect Fujimori\\'s prospects for reelection \\nnext year, they may have further tarnished the image of the \\nPeruvian president, already damaged by his narrow victory in the \\nconstitutional referendum last October. \\n   BOX \\n   Media Doubts over Earlier Shining Path Peace Letters \\n   -- Following the first Guzman letter calling for peace talks, \\nannounced by Fujimori at thee United Nations last October (Radio \\nProgramas del Peru, 1 October 1993), the conservative daily El \\nComercio reported that one seasoned political observer had \\nwarned\" that Guzman\\'s \"reported\" desire \"to reach a peace \\nagreement\" does not mean there is reason \"to claim a victory in \\nthe ongoing struggle against terrorism\" since, according to the \\nobserver, the imprisoned insurgent leader may no longer control \\nthe Shining Path (2 October 1993). \\n   -- Following the second Guzman letter, which supplemented the \\ncall for peace talks with what seemed to be praise for Fujimori\\'s \\neconomic and political program (Lima Global de Television, 1O \\nOctober 1993), a commentator for the anti-Fujimori weekly Caretas \\nwrote that the government was using a \"broken\" Guzman \"in the \\ncampaign for the \\'yes\\' vote\" for the upcoming referendum, adding \\nthat \"it is no coincidence that the letters . . . have come out \\nduring the 3O days prior\" to the 31 October vote (14 October \\n1993). \\n   -- Responding similarly to the second Guzman letter, an editorial \\nin La Republica wondered whether \"government representatives,\" \\nworking to promote the \"yes\" vote on the referendum, had not \\n\"fallen into a trap\" by thinking that Shining Path militants \\nwould take seriously such an \"unctuous\" call for peace talks as \\nappeared in the letter (14 October 1993). \\n   -- Also in response to the second letter, Caretas on 14 October \\nclaimed that Fujimori was \"using\" Guzman \"in the campaign\" to win \\nthe 31 October referendum, noting that \"with Guzman\\'s letters\" \\ncalling for peace talks, Fujimori\\'s \"promise\" to wipe out the \\nShining Path by 1995 \"may gain credibility.\" \\n   END BOX \\n(AUTHOR:  ROLLINS.

If a really major storm were to hit Miami today, it would be totally different from the big hurricane that hit Miami in 1926. A storm today with winds topping 155 mph could cause water levels to reach 9 feet on Biscayne Boulevard in downtown Miami and over 13 feet in low lying areas south of the city.\\nIntroduction:\\nHURRICANES ARE part of the romance of the tropics. The great storms have made\\nfictional plots of B movies and unmade real dreams of people who would implant\\ncivilization in an environment that could be swallowed up by nature in a\\nmoment.\\nA hurricane ended the dream of a railroad down the Florida Keys in\\n1935 and virtually isolated Key West for two years. Nine years earlier, a \"Big\\nOne\" had stopped Miami\\'s first real-estate boom in its tracks, pushing\\nfloodwaters inland to the new jai alai fronton near where Miami International\\nAirport sits today.  \\n\\nNewspaper headlines have documented Miami\\'s subsequent hurricanes. The city\\nwas \"Lashed\" in \\'47, \"Slammed\" in \\'49 and \"Pounded\" in \\'50. The last to hit\\nMiami was Cleo, a small one, in 1964, and the intervening period of calm\\ndefies all odds.\\nMany folks here worry about the \"Big One\" just as\\nCalifornians worry about the Big Quake. What would one of those legendary\\nstorms of the past with 200 mph winds pushing huge tidal surges do to this\\nlow-lying metropolis on the Atlantic? No one is sure.\\nHurricane season\\nofficially extends from June 1 through Nov. 30, and scientists at the National\\nHurricane Center, tucked away on the sixth floor of a nondescript office\\nbuilding in this Miami suburb, are perking up after another winter lull.\\nFrom now until the end of the season, the six hurricane specialists will\\nmonitor weather computers 24 hours a day. In this part of the world,\\ntechnology has made obsolete such disasters as the unnamed hurricane that\\nsurprised Galveston, Texas, in 1900, killing 6,000 people.\\nThe hurricane\\nspecialists use the nation\\'s only working geostationary weather satellite to\\nfollow developing storms. When a disturbance becomes threatening, a specially\\nequipped plane is sent into the storm\\'s heart to measure barometric pressure,\\nwind speed and temperature.\\nOne of the specialists, Lixion Avila, has\\nbegun counting tropical waves that form off the coast of Africa every few days\\nduring hurricane season. About 60 of these waves of air, not water, form every\\nyear. About 20 of them intensify into stronger disturbances, ranging from\\ntropical depressions, with wind speeds to 38 mph; to tropical storms, with\\nwinds from 39 to 73 mph; to hurricanes, with winds exceeding 74 mph.\\nLast\\nyear, 16 tropical depressions developed in the Atlantic. Fourteen became\\ntropical storms, seven of which became hurricanes, fewer than usual.\\nPeople who venture into such dubious endeavors as long-term hurricane\\nforecasting said this could be another light year. But, they said, a\\nrelatively quiet year does not guarantee a thing.\\nOne such year was 1935\\n-- only six hurricanes formed, but one was the strongest to hit the continent.\\nMore than 800 workers, brought down to build the Overseas Highway through the\\nFlorida Keys, were killed when 200 mph winds knocked their evacuation train\\noff the tracks.\\nNO MATTER what long-range forecasters say, scientists at\\nthe Hurricane Center know that the laws of probability are closing in on\\nMiami. They are a conservative bunch, not given to Sunday-supplement scare\\nstories. Miami has grown immensely since the last major storm and is greatly\\noverdue, they said.\\n\"Historically, south Florida has had more hurricanes\\nthan any other site,\" said Jerry Jarrell, a hurricane specialist eyeing\\nMiami\\'s 27-year hiatus nervously. \"We would expect a major hurricane to hit\\nwithin 75 miles of Miami every eight years.\"\\nAt the center, scientists\\nbuilt a computer model to calculate what would happen if the 1926 hurricane\\nwere to hit Miami today. That storm was almost exactly the strength of\\nHurricane Hugo, which hit in South Carolina with 135 mph winds in September\\n1989. The scientists took data from Hugo and applied it to the path taken by\\nthe 1926 hurricane into Miami.\\n\"It would be a totally different story\\nhere,\" said Max Mayfield, who collected photos from the 1926 storm to\\nillustrate the model. \"How many high-rises did they have on those barrier\\nislands up in South Carolina? None. I think all these folks in their Miami\\nBeach condos are going to be in for a rude awakening.\"\\nA worst-case storm,\\nwith winds topping 150 mph, would put 5 feet of water in Joe\\'s Stone Crabs\\nrestaurant, a Miami Beach landmark, and 9 feet of water on Biscayne Boulevard\\nin downtown Miami.

Seshan, early this morning postponed\\nthe remaining two phases of the national parliamentary elections until next\\nmonth. He acted after consulting the president and the acting prime minister.\\n   The first phase of the elections took place Monday, but voting for the\\nremaining 60 percent of the 537 seats at stake will be June 12 and 15 instead\\nof Thursday and Sunday.\\nEyewitnesses at the assassination scene said\\nGandhi\\'s body was ripped apart and decapitated by the force of the explosion.\\nAt least 14 other people, including a senior police officer, died in the\\nblast.\\nOfficials in New Delhi said the blast was caused by either a time\\nbomb or remote-control device. A Congress Party spokesman said the bomb was\\nhidden in a bouquet of flowers offered to Gandhi as he approached the dais for\\nhis speech.\\nIt is not clear whether the bomb was thrown at Gandhi or\\nwhether he was handed flowers that contained explosives. He had been receiving\\nbouquets and garlands all evening.\\nGandhi recently had been shrugging off\\nsecurity guards.\\nThere was no immediate indication who was responsible for\\nthe bomb, but speculation centered on Tamil separatists seeking an independent\\nstate in nearby Sri Lanka.\\nPresident Bush and other world leaders\\nexpressed horror and sadness at the slaying. \"When you look at his\\ncontribution to international order and you think of his decency, it\\'s a\\ntragedy,\" Bush said in Washington.\\nEnd of dynasty\\nGandhi\\'s death marks\\nthe likely end of the political dynasty that has dominated Indian politics\\nsince independence in 1947. Analysts here said there is no obvious successor\\nto him as leader of the Congress Party, which was founded by his grandfather,\\nJawaharlal Nehru, India\\'s first prime minister, and later dominated by his\\nmother, Indira Gandhi, who was prime minister when she was assassinated in\\n1984.\\nThis morning, Gandhi\\'s body was flown to a stunned New Delhi.\\nHis widow, Sonia, sobbed and hugged the couple\\'s daughter Priyanka as the\\nwomen stepped down from the air force Boeing 737 that had flown them to Madras\\nto bring Gandhi\\'s body home.\\nEven before Gandhi\\'s death, more than 150\\npeople had died this week in violence connected to the election.\\nAfter the\\nassassination, violent mobs rampaged along roads leading to Madras on Tuesday\\nnight, smashing vehicles and other property, according to Indian news\\nagencies.\\nGovernment officials in New Delhi ordered all government\\noffices, schools and colleges shut amid widespread fears that the\\nassassination would touch off a wave of violence in a country that has endured\\na spate of riots during the past year, mainly over religious and caste\\nconflicts.\\nOutside Gandhi\\'s house in New Delhi on Tuesday night, hundreds\\nof angry Congress Party workers chanted slogans against the CIA, accusing the\\nU.S. intelligence agency of engineering the assassination. The CIA is often\\nblamed by India\\'s conspiracy-minded political activists for a wide variety of\\nthe country\\'s ills.\\nHome ransacked\\nSome demonstrators in New Delhi set\\nfire to the home of a political rival and attacked foreign camera operators.\\nPeople broke into the house of Gandhi\\'s neighbor, former Labor Minister Ram\\nVilas Paswan, and set furniture ablaze, police said.\\nPolice fired shots in\\nthe air to drive away the angry, shouting crowd. There were no injuries.\\nPaswan, a member of the Janata Dal party, which defeated Gandhi\\'s Congress\\nParty in the 1989 general elections, was not home at the time.\\nSome\\nshocked Indian political leaders told reporters they feared Rajiv Gandhi\\'s\\nassassination augured the death of India\\'s four-decades-old democracy. But\\nothers, including leaders of the main rival to the Congress Party in this\\nelection, the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata Party, denounced the killing\\nand urged the country to remain calm in its aftermath.\\n\"It\\'s a tremendous\\nloss to democracy,\" senior Congress leader Vasant Sathe told reporters. \"The\\nloss can never be made up.\" J.B. Patnaik, a powerful Congress politician in\\nthe eastern state of Orissa, said: \"I don\\'t know what is going to happen now,\\nhow democracy will survive.\"\\nAt the site of the bomb blast in Tamil Nadu,\\nthere was no immediate evidence as to who was responsible.\\nGandhi and his\\nCongress Party have many enemies on the subcontinent, including violent\\nseparatists in Kashmir and Punjab, leftist revolutionaries and rightist Hindu\\nmilitants.\\nGuerrillas suspected\\nMost of the early speculation, however,\\nfocused on Gandhi\\'s most hardened opponents in Tamil Nadu, the Liberation\\nTigers of Tamil Eelam, a disciplined and violent guerrilla force that has used\\nTamil Nadu as a base in its campaign to win a separate state in Sri Lanka, the\\nisland nation just off India\\'s southeastern coast. The Tamil Tigers have\\nassassinated dozens of political enemies in Sri Lanka and southern India,\\noften using powerful plastic explosives set off by remote control.\\nEarlier\\nthis year, the state government of Tamil Nadu was dismissed and central rule\\nimposed after allegations that local politicians were providing aid and\\nprotection to the Tamil Tigers. Gandhi, whose Congress Party provided the main\\nbacking to the New Delhi government at the time, was widely seen as being\\nbehind the dismissal, which angered the Tamil Tigers and their supporters in\\nsouthern India.\\nDuring the current election, the Congress Party faced a\\nbrisk challenge from a leftist coalition led by former Prime Minister V.P.\\nSingh, who denounced what he called Congress\\'s \"culture of corruption\" and\\nadvocated divisive job set-asides for India\\'s lower castes and religious\\nminorities.\\nAn even tougher test for the Congress -- and the centrist\\nideology that has held India together for four decades -- has been mounted by\\nHindu ultranationalists from the Bharatiya Janata Party, who denounced Gandhi\\nfor allegedly pandering to India\\'s Muslim minority and directing too many\\ngovernment resources to religious and caste minorities in an effort to win\\nvotes.\\nElection in India: turmoil and tragedy\\nThe Congress Party, which\\nhas dominated Indian politics since independence in 1947, is being challenged\\nby a center-left coalition that wants to break down the caste system and a\\nright-wing party that seeks a more openly Hindu, less secular India.; ...\\nCaste system\\nHierarchical ranking of social groups rooted in Hindu\\nreligious beliefs that people are born with different intellectual and\\nspiritual qualities and capabilities.

Hispanics are three times as likely to develop diabetes as the general population; 40% of the 700,000 victims in Texas are Mexican-Americans. San Antonio (50% Hispanic) is the center of diabetes investigation, at the University of Texas Health Center, which has attracted a team of investigators from Yale. Researchers are reaching out to the population by taking a mobile home, equipped to test for the disease, out to city neighborhoods. Ultimately they hope to locate a gene presidposing to the disease, which might lead to a screening test. They believe that poor hispanics\\' diet, lack of exercise and medical care increases the risk.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Inside a small motor home, Joanne\\nPierluissi raised her sleeve as nurse Mary Perez inserted a needle\\ninto the vein above her forearm, drawing blood into a tube for a\\ndiabetes test.\\n   As her daughters watched, Pierluissi, 24, said it was for them,\\nas much as for herself, that she agreed to be tested for the deadly\\nkiller of Hispanics.\\n   ``I was concerned because they said an aunt of mine had it and I\\njust wanted to come for the checkup. All of our family is going to\\ngo through the program to make sure that if we have it that we\\'ll do\\nsomething about it.\\'\\'\\n   Twelve million Americans have some form of diabetes, but it is\\nmost prevalent among minorities, especially Native Americans, blacks\\nand Hispanics. Hispanics are three times as likely to develop\\ndiabetes as the general population, and 40 percent of the 700,000\\nvictims in Texas are Mexican-American.\\n   More than 150,000 Americans die from diabetes each year; another\\n150,000 deaths are diabetes-related, according to the American\\nDiabetes Association.\\n   No one really knows what sparks it, but researchers believe\\nHispanics could hold the key. San Antonio, the nation\\'s ninth\\nlargest city, with a population that is 50 percent Hispanic, is\\nbecoming the base for diabetes studies.\\n   Researchers take a customized mobile home to neighborhoods to\\nrandomly check Hispanics and Anglos for the disease, which deprives\\nthe body of insulin and can lead to complications affecting the\\nheart, kidneys, eyes and nerves.\\n   San Antonio\\'s Hispanic makeup led Dr. Ralph DeFronzo to abandon\\nhis prestigious position as a Yale University diabetes researcher\\nand persuade his four-member team to relocate to the University of\\nTexas Health Science Center.\\n   An epidemiologist at the center, Dr. Michael Stern, has devoted\\n10 years to studying Hispanic diabetes and led the grassroots study\\nof Type II diabetes.\\n   Type II, the most common form, develops mostly in obese adults\\nover 40 who also may have a family history of the disease. In obese\\ndiabetics, the body has too much insulin because it is burning more\\nfats than sugars.\\n   Type I diabetes usually develops among adolescents and requires\\nthat they have daily injections of insulin.\\n   Stern said family studies of diabetic patients are brining him\\ncloser to finding the gene that triggers the disease.\\n   A genetic marker might identify people who are susceptible, which\\ncould lead to a screening test, he said. ``Then you could go out and\\nzero in on the genetic susceptibles and you can be more intense on\\nyour recommendations to them and you could also study that group.\\'\\'\\n   Stern believes if people exercised more and ate less of the\\nfat-saturated foods common to the diets of low-income Hispanics,\\nfewer would get the disease.\\n   ``We use the term double jeopardy for Mexican-Americans,\\'\\' he\\nsaid. ``We don\\'t know why, when they get diabetes, they have a more\\nsevere form of the disease _ whether it\\'s a biological difference or\\nis it that they are not getting as good medical care.\\n   ``But the interesting thing is that upper-income\\nMexican-Americans do not have the same risk as low-income\\nMexican-Americans. It may be that the gene is there, but for some\\nreason it may not be expressed in the upper-income Mexican-Americans.\\n   ``Also, Mexican-Americans tend to have more body fat in their\\nupper torso and we can see that as related to diabetes.\\'\\'\\n   Between 1979 and 1988, Stern and his staff studied more than\\n5,000 people and found that 387 of 2,905 Hispanics had the disease,\\nor 13.3 percent, compared to only 87 of 1,780 Anglos, or 4.8 percent.\\n   Researchers believe that poor Hispanics\\' diets of cheap,\\nprocessed foods, lack of exercise and infrequent medical attention _\\neither due to poverty or a cultural bias against doctors _ increases\\ntheir risk of acquiring diabetes.\\n   The study is in its follow-up stage, to see if diagnosed diabetes\\npatients have changed their lifestyle and have sought medical care.\\n   Teresa Castro, 54, whose diabetic husband died at age 37, went\\nthrough the screening eight years ago. She was told that because of\\nher weight, 254 pounds, she had hypertension and was at risk of\\ndiabetes. Doctors put her on a strict, low-fat diet and she lost 26\\npounds.\\n   ``I went to the screening because they called and said it was\\nfree. That\\'s why I went to it, because being poor I couldn\\'t afford\\nto go to the doctor for this type of checkup,\\'\\' she said. ``My\\nmother has diabetes and they tell me I might have diabetes, too, but\\nI don\\'t know too much about it.\\n   ``I feel OK, but they tell me that one year you can be OK and the\\nnext year, it can be totally different.\\'\\'\\n   DeFronzo, who in 1988 was chosen the top diabetes investigator by\\nCanadian and Japanese diabetes associations, says his unit at the\\nHealth Science Center will try to use many of Stern\\'s patients for\\nresearch. That will include work for Lipha Chemicals, which makes an\\nanti-diabetic drug called metaforim that improves the body\\'s ability\\nto respond to insulin.\\n   ``The problem with Type II diabetics is not that they don\\'t make\\nenough insulin; they don\\'t respond to the insulin,\\'\\' DeFronzo said.\\n``What we\\'d like to do is make them more responsive and this drug\\nwill do that.\\'\\'\\n   The drug is widely used in Europe, Canada and Mexico and should\\nbe approved by the Food and Drug Administration in several years for\\nU.S. use, he said.\\n   Educating elementary-school-age children about healthy diets\\nwould help reduce the number of diabetes cases, DeFronzo said. ``If\\nyou have a 65-year-old mother who weighs 220 pounds and you tell her\\nto go out and jog five miles Monday, Wednesday and Friday, she is\\ngoing to laugh at you.\\n   ``So you have to design an exercise program that is compatible\\nwith the patient\\'s lifestyle and it is something they can do.\\'\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAs the November 17 House vote on NAFTA approaches, the White House is summoning undecided congressmen, business leaders and journalists for intimate briefings in order to sway their votes. To win the votes of 8 Hispanic congressmen, Clinton will soon announce support for a North American Development Bank to fund projects in communities hit by job losses resulting from NAFTA. Cabinet members are traveling to congressional districts to publicize factories expected to gain jobs under NAFTA. Clinton spoke at an exhibit of products likely to benefit, while the AFL-CIO presented speakers who lost their jobs when their employers moved to Mexico.\\nIntroduction:\\nTHE Clinton administration will soon announce support for a North American\\nDevelopment Bank, which would fund projects in communities hit by job losses\\nresulting from the North American Free Trade Agreement.\\nThe so-called NADBank has been strongly supported by Congressman Esteban\\nTorres, who has insisted on some sort of lending institution to support\\nadjustment throughout the continent. Agreement by the administration is\\nexpected to bring Mr Torres and at least 7 other Hispanic congressmen into\\nthe pro-Nafta fold.\\nThe administration believes it can garner 200-210 pro-Nafta votes, out of\\nthe 218 needed. It is assuming that every undecided congressman only wants a\\nreason - favourable constituent mail - to vote for the pact, and it is\\npushing feverishly to turn anti-Nafta public opinion around.\\nThe White House \\'war room\\' believes the vote currently breaks down into 110\\nRepublicans in favour, 65-75 Democrats in favour; and 20-30 leaning towards\\nit. Under this hopeful scenario, the White House will use the last few days\\nbefore the November 17 House vote to cajole, bargain and twist arms to get\\nthe remaining 8 votes.\\nHowever the anti-Nafta forces expect a different outcome. They count 190-200\\nDemocrats against, 10-15 Democrats leaning against, and 5-10 Republicans\\nopposed.\\nThe pro-Nafta campaign this week began moving into high gear. State by\\nstate, undecided congressmen are being lured to the White House for intimate\\nbriefings, as are business leaders and journalists.\\nMembers of the cabinet are being sent to congressional districts, where they\\nvisit and publicise factories that are expected to gain jobs if Nafta\\npasses.\\nPresident Bill Clinton on Wednesday gave his second impassioned speech on\\nNafta at an exhibit on the White House lawn of products likely to benefit\\nfrom Nafta. He envisioned continent-wide free trade \\'when we\\'ll have over\\n700m people in this trading bloc, united in believing that we can help one\\nanother grow and flourish,\\' he said.\\nThe Nafta opposition has been just as busy. Across town, the AFL-CIO trade\\nunion grouping on Wednesday had its own products exhibit, but those were\\nlikely to be hurt by Nafta.

Since independence, the UN embargo on trade with Serbia has meant loss of a large market and an end to cheap Serbian raw materials. Slovenia is lowering wages and increasing productivity to compensate. It is privatizing industries and implementing market reforms, determined to become a market-oriented, multi-party, parliamentary democracy. Relations with Croatia are good but complicated by several issues. Slovenian leaders criticize the west for failing to intervene earlier to stop Serbia\\'s aggression against a UN-recognized state, and for terming the Bosnian war civil or ethnic.\\nIntroduction:\\nSLOVENES always had at least as much in common with their Alpine neighbours\\nas with their Balkan partners in the former Yugoslavia. Since Slovenia\\'s\\ndeclaration of independence in June 1991, the gap between the peaceful,\\nethnically homogeneous new republic of 2m people and the war-impoverished\\nrest of former Yugoslavia has widened inexorably.\\n\\'We have been very lucky,\\' says President Milan Kucan, the wily former\\ncommunist who led Slovenia\\'s drive for independence from the Serb- dominated\\nfederation. But he, like Mr Janez Drnovsek, the prime minister of Slovenia\\'s\\nthree-pronged coalition government, makes clear that Slovenia suffers\\neconomically from the disintegration of Yugoslavia and would be one of the\\nprincipal gainers from a resolution of the bloody Balkan imbroglio.\\n\\'Slovenia\\'s southern border with Croatia has become the border between peace\\nand war in Europe,\\' Mr Kucan declares.\\nA glance at the map shows what he means. At its narrowest point, only a 46\\nkm- long strip of Slovenian coast- line separates Italy from the rest of\\nformer Yugoslavia. Austria is insulated from the war-torn regions of Croatia\\nand Bosnia-Herzegovina, both once ruled by the Austrian Habs- burgs, thanks\\nto its own 324 km-long border with Slovenia.\\nBut Slovenia would hate to be perceived merely as a convenient cordon\\nsanitaire. The new Karavanke road tunnel beneath the Alps, completed just\\nbefore the 10-day war between Slovenia and the Yugoslav army which\\nimmediately followed indep- endence, has underlined Slovenia\\'s traditional\\nimportance as a transit route.\\nThe railways and the motorway leading south through the capital Ljubljana to\\nthe Slovenian port of Koper and its Italian neighbour Trieste carry freight\\nand travellers heading to and from central Europe and the Adriatic sea. The\\nhighway is also thick with aid trucks and an ever-decreasing volume of\\n\\'normal\\' cargoes moving south-east towards Croatia.\\nIndependence has, above all, brought peace to Slovenia and left it free to\\nimplement the kind of rational market reforms and privatisation policies\\nwhich remain blocked in the republics absorbed and impoverished by war\\nfurther south.\\nEconomists, however, are quick to point out that independence has its costs.\\nSlovenia, with its self- contained infrastructure and proximity to western\\nmarkets, was always by far the richest republic of the former federation.\\nIts per capita GDP of around Dollars 6,000 was three times higher than that\\nof Serbia and five times that of Kosovo, the poorest region of the former\\nYugoslavia.\\nSlovenia has always had a strong tourism industry of its own. But it also\\nbenefited from the overnight stays of foreign tourists heading further south\\nto Croatia\\'s Dalmatian coast. Now the once-thriving seaside hotels are\\nfilled with discons- olate refugees and Croatia\\'s main source of hard\\ncurrency income has disappeared. So have the transit tourists through\\nSlovenia.\\nAbove all, Slovene enterprises were able to build up exports to the rest of\\nEurope, thanks to the volume of sales they were able to make in Yugoslavia\\nwhich virtually gave them a 22m strong domestic market.\\nThe UN embargo on trade with Serbia means both the loss of the largest of\\nthe former Yugoslav markets and an end to cheap Serbian raw materials and\\nother inputs. These helped restrain costs and improve competitiveness in\\nmore demanding hard currency markets. Now Slovenia has to lower real wages\\nand increase productivity in order to compensate.\\nOn the positive side of the balance sheet, however, the end of the federal\\nstate means that Slovenia no longer has to contribute over Dollars 1bn a\\nyear to finance the bloated Yugoslav army or see its hard currency deposits\\n\\'frozen\\' by the National Bank of Yugoslavia, as happened before\\nindependence.\\nRelations with Croatia, Slovenia\\'s southern neighbour, are generally good\\nbut they are complicated by three contentious issues.\\nThe first of these is the border itself, which is disputed in parts. The\\nsecond issue contains Croatia\\'s share of the running costs of the Krsko\\nnuclear plant on Slovenian territory. The plant was built and financed\\njointly to supply electricity to both republics but financially hard-pressed\\nCroatia is now reluctant to pay its share of the running costs. The third\\noutstanding issue concerns compensation for the assets of Ljubljanska Banka\\nin Croatia.\\nThere is no nostalgia for the old Yugoslavia, which Slovenes tried without\\nsuccess to trans- form into a looser confederal structure. But a mixture of\\ncompassion for the suffering of their fellow southern Slavs and economic\\nloss ensures that the Slovene authorities, while categorically ruling out\\nany possibility of resuming old political ties with former Yugoslavia, pray,\\nwithout much hope, for a quick and lasting solution to the conflict and the\\nresumption of normal economic ties.\\nThe war, with its violent and deliberate displacement of millions of people,\\nhas and is taking place in the ethnically mixed border lands of Croatia and\\nBosnia relatively distant from the Slovene border. Both Mr Kucan and Mr\\nDrnovsek, who headed the old revolving Yugoslav state presidency for a year\\nbefore negotiating the exodus of the federal army from Slovenia in July\\n1991, criticise the failure of the west to intervene more forcibly to stop\\nat an early stage what Mr Kucan calls \\'the war of aggression waged by\\nSerbia.\\'\\nThe president is particularly scathing against what he calls the west\\'s\\ndefinition of the war in Bosnia as a civil or ethnic war. \\'Of course the\\npeople who are dying do not care how it is defined. But for the inter-\\nnational community it is essential to define it as a war of aggression\\nagainst a UN- recognised state and draw the appropriate conclusions. It is a\\ntragedy that Bosnia\\'s elected leader has now been reduced by the\\ninternational com- munity to merely one of sev- eral ethnic leaders,\\' he\\nadds.\\nPreventing the war in parts of former Yugoslavia destabilising Slovenia and\\nscaring off tourists remains a top priority for the new republic.\\nThe border with Croatia is now in effect sealed against further immigation\\nafter 70,000 refugees, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of the local population,\\nwere taken in. Refugees are housed and cared for by local authorities around\\nthe country, often in former Yugoslav army barracks, at an annual cost of\\naround Dollars 250m. Many are expected to stay even after the war ends.\\nMeanwhile, the coalition government which emerged from last December\\'s\\nelections to the national parliament and parallel presidential elections, is\\ndetermined to use its four-year mandate to complete the transformation of\\nthe country into a fully-fledged, market-orientated, multi-party\\nparliamentary democracy.\\nAt the core of the government is an alliance between the Liberal Democrats,\\nheaded by Mr Drnovsek, which emerged as the largest single party with 25 per\\ncent of seats in parliament, and the Christian Democrats led by Mr Lojze\\nPeterle, the foreign minister. But the coalition also includes the four\\nparty \\'associated list\\', made up principally of reformed communists. This\\nhelps to give the coalition a wider parliamentary base.\\nThe inclusion of the \\'left- wing\\' parties, with their traditional links to\\nworkers and the trade unions showed its value last month when they twice\\ngave their assent to a new wages pact designed to reduce real incomes.\\nIndependent economists calculate that average real incomes have to fall\\naround 10 per cent from current levels of around DM650 a month if the\\nSlovenian economy is to compete effectively for new markets in the west and\\nattract foreign investment. Both are needed to reverse the rise in\\nunemployment and build on the structural reforms to the banking system and\\nprivatisation which are currently under way.\\nThe next four years will be crucial. But much has been achieved in the first\\n20 months of independence - including the establishment of a parliamentary\\ndemocracy and a virtually convertible independent currency, the Slovene\\ntolar, backed by strong reserves. The new republic is peaceful,\\ninternationally recognised and a member of the most important inter-\\nnational institutions. By the end of the century it wants to be eligible for\\nfull membership of an enlarged European Community.\\nAs elsewhere in the region, privatisation and other structural reforms are\\nseen as laying the basis for the development of a self-confident middle\\nclass capable of ensuring that the democratic and economic reforms under way\\nin Slovenia become irreversible.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nClimatologist Ira Browning said there was a 50-50 chance of a major earthquake today along the New Madrid Fault, which stretches from Arkansas northeast through New Madrid, Missouri and into Cairo, Illinois. No tremors were reported. Some residents took precautions, however: some schools closed, some residents left town and some purchased earthquake emergency kits. The U.S. Geological Survey, which received many calls from area residents, did not back the prediction. Waverly Person of the Survey says, \"Although earthquakes can be tracked historically, forecasting them is difficult, if not impossible. Mr. Browning\\'s prediction was based on a study of tidal forces.\\nIntroduction:\\n   At least four moderate earthquakes rattled\\nparts of the world, but there was nary a tremor Monday along the\\nNew Madrid Fault, where a scientist said a earthquake was likely to\\noccur.\\n   ``This is just a normal day,\\'\\' said Waverly Person, chief of the\\nU.S. Geological Survey\\'s National Earthquake Information Center.\\n``We\\'re not backing the prediction at all.\\'\\'\\n   Along the New Madrid Fault, some schools were canceled and\\nresidents purchased earthquake emergency kits and others left town,\\njust in case climatologist Iben Browning was right.\\n   Browning said there was a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake\\nearly this week along the fault, which stretches from Marked Tree,\\nArk., northeast through New Marid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill. He believes\\ntidal forces can trigger earthquakes, a theory most scientists\\nreject.\\n   ``There\\'s just no way to predict an earthquake precisely,\\'\\' said\\nPerson, who has been with the U.S. Geological Survey for more than\\n25 years. ``There are no two earthquakes alike.\\'\\'\\n   The center received more than 50 calls about the New Madrid\\nforecast Monday morning and hundreds last week, said Person, who\\nbegan doing interviews for radio and television stations just after\\nmidnight.\\n   As Person talked, 24 seismographs etched out activity recorded\\nby monitoring equipment in different parts of the United States,\\nranging from Alaska to Tennessee.\\n   A needle jumped a few inches across the seismograph connected to\\nmonitoring equipment in Tonopah, Nev. Person scanned the chart and\\ncalled to a colleague, ``It may be a nuclear test. That\\'s where\\nthey conduct those tests.\\'\\'\\n   A few minutes later, the needle jumped again. ``That\\'s not a\\ntest,\\'\\' he said. ``That\\'s a quake.\\'\\'\\n   With a measured eye, he estimated the quake was magnitude 2.5 to\\n3.0 on the Richter scale.

Exxon noted that these costs were the major reason for their lower net income for the year, but analysts said that Exxon\\'s size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage. Exxon\\'s stock has lagged behind that of major oil firms and Exxon could suffer from continuing negative publicity from the Valdez spill and the subsequent heating oil spill into a waterway between New York and New Jersey.\\nIntroduction:\\nExxon Corp. on Wednesday increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of \\ncleaning up the massive Alaskan oil spill to $2 billion and said it would take \\nanother $500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is \\nnow the most expensive environmental disaster in history. \\n\\nIn reporting its estimated 1989 earnings, Exxon said it would take a \\n$500-million charge in the fourth quarter for costs to clean up the spill of 11 \\nmillion gallons of oil that spilled from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez and \\nfouled the shoreline of pristine Prince William Sound last March. \\n\\nThe charges reduced Exxon\\'s 1989 net income to $3.8 billion, compared to $5.26 \\nbillion in 1988. Revenue totaled $96.1 billion in 1989, compared to $88.6 \\nbillion the year before. \\n\\nOn Wednesday, Exxon spokesman William Smith upped the company\\'s estimate of the \\nspill\\'s total costs so far -- costs to Exxon and others -- to \"about $2 \\nbillion.\" The figure does not include any liability from more than 150 lawsuits \\nExxon faces from the spill, nor does it include additional cleanup costs should \\nExxon resume work in the spring. \\n\\nThe fourth-quarter charge comes in addition to $880 million that the company \\nalready set aside in the first and second quarters, bringing Exxon\\'s total \\ncleanup costs for the year to $1.38 billion. Other costs will be covered by \\n\"more than $400 million\" in insurance, Smith said. \\n\\nAnalysts were not surprised at the additional charge, though \"it was a lot \\nbigger than I expected,\" said Joel D. Fischer, an analyst with Drexel Burnham \\nLambert Inc. in New York. Wall Street showed little reaction to the news, with \\nExxon\\'s stock falling only 12.5 cents to close at $47 a share. \\n\\n\"The financial effect of the Exxon Valdez accident was clearly the major reason \\nfor lower net income in 1989,\" said Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a \\nstatement. \\n\\nThe charges from the Valdez cleanup were partly offset by a one-time gain from \\na change in accounting methods in the first quarter as a result of changes in \\nfederal tax law. That raised Exxon\\'s income by $535 million for the year. \\n\\nWithout the cleanup charge and accounting gain, Exxon said its net income for \\nthe year would have been $4.7 billion, down 10.6% from 1988, despite higher oil \\nand gas prices. The decline resulted mainly from slimmer refining and marketing \\nprofit margins and lower earnings from chemical operations. In the fourth \\nquarter, earnings before the Valdez charge were $1.28 billion, compared to \\n$1.38 billion in the 1988 quarter. \\n\\nAnalysts said Exxon\\'s size would insulate it from serious long-term financial \\ndamage from the charges. \"I think they did end the year on a strong note, \\nlargely because of the strength in crude and natural gas pricing,\" said Eugene \\nNowak, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. \\n\\nStill, Exxon\\'s stock, whose performance has lagged behind that of other major \\noil firms, could suffer from continuing negative publicity surrounding the \\nValdez spill and the subsequent spill of 567,000 gallons of heating oil into \\nthe Arthur Kill waterway between New York and New Jersey on Jan. 2. The bad \\npress will undoubtedly be aggravated when the criminal trial begins next week \\nof the Exxon Valdez\\'s captain, Joseph Hazelwood. \\n\\nSmith declined to say what costs the new $500-million charge would cover. The \\nprevious charges covered everything from wages to boat rentals to boots, as \\nwell as payments so far of $177 million in claims by fishermen, cannery workers \\nand other individuals affected by the spill, said Exxon spokesman James \\nRobertson in Anchorage. \\n\\nIn addition, the state of Alaska has asked Exxon to reimburse it for about \\n$34.5 million in costs; so far, Exxon has paid the state $7.4 million in cash \\nand has agreed to pay bills amounting to $23 million more, said the state\\'s Oil \\nSpill Coordinating Office. Exxon must also reimburse the U.S. Coast Guard and \\nother federal agencies. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Exxon confirmed Wednesday that it would shut down its Denver \\nexploration and production office, which employs about 105 people. The office\\'s \\noperations will be transferred to Midland, Tex. No decision has been made on \\nthe future of the workers in Denver, said Exxon spokesman Les Rogers in \\nHouston. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nScientists report that a solar eclipse recorded on a Syrian clay tablet as occurring on May 3, 1375 B.C. really happened about 150 years later on March 5, 1223 B.C. The scientists compared the criteria stated on the tablet, e.g., Mars visible, and the likely age range of the tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible from Ugarit, where the tablet was found. Only the later date fit the bill. Even so, it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse.

In Angola, illegal mining began in May 1991 when a peace accord allowed freedom of movement. The De Beers cartel is trying to buy up the $1 million a day in diamonds being smuggled out to preserve market stability, which it does by maintaining a buffer pool of diamonds and matching supply to demand. After 1980s speculators were bankrupted when recession forced them to dump diamonds faster than the cartel could buy them, it has educated banks to discourage lending to speculators.\\nIntroduction:\\nIT IS ironic that there is an unprecedented, greedy rush for diamonds by\\nminers in Angola and Canada precisely at a time when the diamond business is\\nin turmoil and questions are inevitably being asked about the ability of the\\nworld\\'s most successful cartel to keep its tight grip on the market.\\nIn Canada\\'s Northwest Territories, the discovery of 81 small diamonds, some\\nof gem quality, has sparked the biggest rush to stake mining claims in the\\nhistory of the North American industry.\\nStakers are using helicopters because each claim area is so large and\\nprospectors have claimed every piece of land within 300 km (185 miles) of\\nthe discovery.\\nIn spite of all this hectic activity, it is very unlikely that anyone will\\nfind enough big diamonds to make the development of Canada\\'s first diamond\\nmine worthwhile.\\nThe odds in favour of making a fortune are much better for the diamond\\nhunters in Angola. More than Dollars 1m-worth of gem diamonds a day are\\nbeing smuggled out of that country for sale in Antwerp.\\nAn estimated 50,000 private-enterprise diggers are at work already and their\\nnumbers are being swelled by 500 a day. This rise of illegal mining,\\nparticularly in the Cuango region, which produces 80 per cent of Angola\\'s\\ndiamonds and some of its highest-quality gem stones, started in May, 1991,\\nafter the peace accord which allowed freedom of movement for the first time\\nin 16 years.\\nAs well as experienced miners, many soldiers who could not find civilian\\njobs have made their way to the diamond areas. The onset of the dry season\\nand the fall in river levels from the end of May this year has encouraged\\nwhat De Beers, the South African group that dominates the world diamond\\nbusiness, describes as \\'a sudden and unprecedented explosion in the supply\\nof illicit Angolan diamonds reaching the market\\'.\\nEven though there are so many diggers at work, questions are being asked\\nabout whether there might be more to this \\'explosion.\\' Did Unita, Angola\\'s\\nrebel movement, build up a stockpile which is now being released? Is\\nEndiama, Angola\\'s state-owned diamond company, implicated in some way? In\\nthe murky world of diamond dealing such rumours abound.\\nDe Beers probably knows the answers because its intelligence network is\\nremarkable.\\nWhat is also remarkable is that all those scrambling for diamonds in Angola\\nor dropping out of the skies to stake expensive claims in Canada take it for\\ngranted that the diamond cartel will be able to continue to keep prices up\\nand make all their efforts worthwhile.\\nThe cartel has survived partly because nobody needs diamonds. They are\\ncomposed of very hard carbon so they can be useful for drilling holes in\\ntough material, but there are substitutes for this use. Gem diamonds are\\nsolely for decoration and serve no useful purpose.\\nBut the cartel has ensured that rough (uncut) diamond prices have risen\\nsteadily since the 1930s - even when in the depths of the 1981-86 recession\\nthe price of a top-quality, one carat gem diamond slumped in the retail\\nmarket from Dollars 60,000 to Dollars 10,000.\\nThe cartel is organised by De Beers\\' London-based Central Selling\\nOrganisation, which markets about 80 per cent of the world\\'s rough diamonds.\\nApart from De Beers\\' own production from Namibia and South Africa, the CSO\\nhandles rough gem diamonds from Angola, Australia, Botswana, Russia,\\nTanzania and Zaire.\\nThe CSO has been mopping up as many of the smuggled Angolan diamonds as\\npossible to stop havoc being created in a business already suffering\\nseverely from soggy demand in the US and Japan, the two biggest markets,\\nwhich share about two-thirds of demand between them.\\nDe Beers says that, because times are tough. it will probably have to cut\\nits annual dividend payment for the first time since 1981. It has also told\\nthe producers to cut deliveries by 25 per cent - something the CSO contracts\\npermit at times of stress.\\nDe Beers releases a controlled stream of rough diamonds to the market\\nthrough \\'sights\\' offered by the CSO ten times a year to about 160 selected\\nbuyers. They are offered boxes of diamonds, each worth between Dollars\\n500,000 and Dollars 25m. The contents are judged by the CSO to balance the\\nrequirements of the buyers with market demand. Buyers have either to accept\\nall the diamonds or reject the box.\\nMr Harry Oppenheimer, whose family effectively controls both De Beers and\\nits sister group, the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, was\\ndefending the cartel again last week at the formal opening of the R1.1bn\\nVenetia diamond mine in the Transvaal. \\'The CSO does not, and could not, run\\na monopolistic system,\\' he said. \\'In bad times like this, I sometimes wish\\nthat we could. The fact is that the level of world diamond production, which\\nis carried on in many countries, cannot be controlled. Diamond prices cannot\\nbe fixed artificially but have to be set at a level which allows production\\nand consumption to be equated.\\n\\'What the CSO for many years has done successfully, is to operate a buffer\\npool, stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating its stocks when demand\\nis in excess of the level of supply. In this way it has been able to\\npreserve an essential degree of stability in the price of this ultimate\\nluxury of gem diamonds, to the common advantage of producers, processors and\\nconsumers of this unique natural product.\\'\\nAll very altruistic. But De Beers makes huge profits from its diamond\\nbusiness - a record Dollars 1.24bn in 1990 and more than Dollars 1bn last\\nyear.\\nThe cartel nearly lost control of the market in the early 1980s. It was a\\ntime of galloping inflation, a weak dollar and low interest rates.\\nMerchants, particularly in Israel, stockpiled diamonds on borrowed money as\\na hedge against inflation and when recession hit they had to dump diamonds\\nfaster than the Central Selling Organisation could mop them up. The CSO\\'s\\ndiamond stocks, worth under Dollars 1bn in 1980 rose to Dollars 1.9bn by\\n1984. Hundreds of diamond investment trusts and traders were bankrupted at\\nthat time and Australia and Zaire challenged De Beers\\' near-monopoly.\\nDe Beers has taken good care that merchant stocks have never again been\\nbuilt for speculative reasons, frequently going to the banks, the potential\\nfinanciers of stockpiling operations, to \\'educate\\' them about the way the\\ndiamond market works.\\nAfter the bust came boom. Diamond sales in value terms jumped by 20 per cent\\nin 1987 and another 37 per cent the following year. To cool the market, the\\nCSO imposed swingeing price increases: 13.5 per cent in May 1988 and 15.5\\nper cent in March 1989. Underlying the boom was phenomenal growth in demand\\nfor diamonds in Japan where lack of living space encourages people to\\ndisplay their wealth by buying small but expensive items. The CSO boosted\\nthe trend with clever promotion so that today diamond engagement rings are\\nregularly exchanged in Japan whereas forthcoming marriages traditionally\\nwere celebrated over a cup of rice wine.\\nIt must be open to question whether another Japan can be found to lift the\\ndiamond market as the present recession ends.\\nBut in the meantime Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, De Beers\\' chairman, insists\\nthat the CSO\\'s control of the diamond market is not slipping.\\n\\'By mopping up Angolan supplies we can say that more of the world\\'s rough\\ndiamonds are passing through the CSO than ever before,\\' he says. \\'By\\napplying the deferred purchases clauses in our contracts with producers we\\nare applying the right medicine to ensure that demand matches supply and\\nthat the diamond market will remain stable\\'.\\nThe future of De Beers\\' diamond operations in Namibia were discussed with\\nthe government there yesterday. In the past there have been suggestions that\\nCDM, De Beers\\' wholly-owned subsidiary, might be at least partly\\nnationalised. CDM, has diamond mining operations over a coastal area\\nextending 100 km north of the Orange River and recently brought the Auchas\\nand Elizabeth Bay mines into production.

Millions are being put into the Jwaneng mine in Botswana to continue open pit digging for 35 years, after which mining may go underground. Jwaneng, the richest diamond mine in the world, is co-owned by Botswana and De Beers and is the major Botswana revenue source. At the De Beers-owned Finsch mine in South Africa, digging has gone underground to give the mine another 35-40 years of life, with remote- controlled trucks digging out material in dangerous areas.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe Jwaneng mine, on the fringes of the Kalahari desert in Botswana, is\\nknown as \\'a gem in the world of gems\\' because it almost certainly is the\\nrichest diamond mine in the world - at least in terms of the value of the\\nstones it yields. Jwaneng\\'s position is being reinforced by a USDollars 160m\\nexpansion programme at present being completed three months ahead of\\nschedule and under budget.\\nMeanwhile, 160km west of Kimberley in the northern Cape Province of South\\nAfrica, another diamond mine, the Finsch, where operations started in 1964,\\nhas been given a new lease of life.\\nHaving dug an open pit 423 metres deep, miners have now gone underground. Mr\\nSimon Webb, the general manager, says that the underground development has\\ngiven it another 35 to 40 years of life.\\nAll this goes to show that De Beers, the South African group that dominates\\nworld trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, still has complete faith in its\\nability to maintain stability in the diamond market despite short-term\\ndifficulties such as those the company is experiencing with Russia. It also\\nremains intent on maintaining its diamond output even though its\\n100-year-old mines at Kimberley are now running down.\\nThe South African group believes that its control of at least 50 per cent of\\nworld diamond production gives it a powerful base from which to negotiate\\nwith the other producers who have marketing contracts with De Beers\\' Central\\nSelling Organisation,\\nIn Botswana De Beers controls half of Debswana, the company that owns the\\nJwaneng mine, with the government owning the rest. The value of Jwaneng to\\nBotswana cannot be overstated.\\nIt, and the country\\'s two other (smaller) diamond mines, between them\\naccount for 50 per cent of the government\\'s revenue and 40 per cent of the\\ncountry\\'s gross domestic product. No wonder Jwaneng\\'s company slogan is Re\\nphtas imisa Botswana, which translates as \\'We make Botswana sparkle\\'.\\nProduction started at Jwaneng in 1982. Now a so-called fourth stream is\\nbeing completed which is adding one-third to processing capacity. In turn,\\nthis means a 21 per cent rise in the number of carats produced. Last year\\nthe mine treated 5.8m tonnes of ore which yielded 8.546m carats of diamonds,\\nwell below the 1992 output when the 5.77m tonnes treated gave up more than\\n9m carats.\\nJwaneng\\'s open pit has reached a depth of 190 metres. Already it is 2kms\\nlong and 1km wide. Mr Loz Shaw, chief geologist, says drilling down to 600\\nmetres shows there are still plenty of diamonds at that depth and so the pit\\nwill go down at least that far.\\nMr Derrick Moore, the general manager, says this indicates mining in the\\nopen pit will last another 35 years - \\'and then we might go underground\\'.\\nIf experience at De Beers\\' wholly-owned Finsch mine in South Africa is\\nanything to go by, planning the underground development at Jwaneng might\\nalready have started.\\nPlanning for the underground mine at Finsch started in the 1970s and the\\nfirst work began in 1979. Yet the bottom of the Finsch open pit - 423 metres\\n -was not reached until 1990.\\nUnfortunately, things did not go completely as expected when underground\\nmining started, to some extent because the development was designed by a\\nmanagement whose expertise was mainly in open pit mining.\\nHowever, Mr Mark Button, mining superintendent, says: \\'Finsch has come of\\nage as an underground mine after two years. Our costs compare with the best\\nin the group.\\'\\nAmong the innovations that have helped Finsch achieve its objectives are\\nsome remote-controlled LHD (load-haul-dump) trucks which are similar to\\nradio-controlled toy vehicles or boats. Using VHF radio signals, a driver\\ncan stand back and send a truck on its own to dig out material from areas\\nbetween the old pit wall and the underground development that would not\\notherwise be mined because of the dangers involved. When, as occasionally\\nhappens, rock crashes on to the LHD trucks, it is relatively simply to haul\\nthe vehicles out virtually undamaged.\\nMr Webb says the objective is to mine down to a depth of 830 metres, at\\nwhich point there are not enough diamonds left in the ground to make\\nrecovery viable.\\nFinsch - named after the discoverers, Messrs Fincham and Schwabel, who\\nstumbled across the kimberlite pipe containing the diamonds when actually\\nthey were looking for asbestos - is one of the victims of the present\\nturmoil in the diamond market caused mainly by uncertainties about Russian\\nexports.\\nAbout 500 of its 1,900 employees were laid off in August 1992. It is mining\\nonly five days a week at present and processing on four days. Last year\\nFinsch mined 2.68m tonnes and recovered 2m carats of diamonds compared with\\n4.7m tonnes mined and 3.446m carats in 1992.\\nMr Webb suggests 1994 output will be similar to last year\\'s. But when market\\nconditions improve, production can be brought back up to previous levels in\\nabout six months.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Maoist Shining Path guerrillas have brought their own brand of law and order to the Upper Huallaga River Valley.

The same shopkeepers complain\\nbitterly about the local police who take what they want without ever\\noffering to pay.\\n   In a rare conversation with reporters, a Shining Path political\\nofficer, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, gave an\\nexample of the kind of law the guerrillas have laid down: ``Do not\\nsteal so much as a needle or thread and return what you borrow.\\'\\'\\n   In a nation where economic chaos reigns and few laws are\\nrespected, the Shining Path is setting down clear rules and making\\nthem stick.\\n   ``In a sense they enforce a hyper-Christian morality _ except\\nthey kill you if you break the rules,\\'\\' said the Rev.

In North Dakota, the nation\\'s most agriculturally dependent state, more that 49,000 producers shared $410.2 million. The state lost two-thirds of its 1988 spring wheat. The disaster payments reduced statewide losses by $1.2 billion. Other drought-ravaged states were Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Disaster aid and crop insurance put $500 million into Iowa\\'s economy, staving off bankruptcies and other financial problems. A university survey reported drought aid added $15,000 to the average farmer\\'s net cash income of $6,300. These states still need a good year to get back on their feet, and it was not 1989.\\nIntroduction:\\n   The drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper\\nMidwest _ perhaps nowhere harder than in North Dakota. More\\ndisaster relief aid went there than to any other state. The third\\nstory in a four-part series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,\\'\\'\\nexamines how the $3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmers\\nmost in need.\\n   Carl Grindberg survived the drought with\\na $45,000 dose of federal aid. But for this farmer and others, it\\nwas a give-and-take bailout: Take the money with one hand, give it\\naway with the other.\\n   ``The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid,\\'\\' Grindberg\\nsaid. ``The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and\\nchemicals and tires, they got paid. What I\\'m saying is, the farmer\\ngot the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.\\'\\'\\n   The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 million\\ninto North Dakota, the nation\\'s most agriculturally dependent\\nstate. The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many\\nsay it also kept the state afloat.\\n   ``It\\'s what carried us through in 1988,\\'\\' said Cass County\\nextension agent Duane Hauck. ``If it hadn\\'t been for drought aid,\\nthe economic situation all through North Dakota would have been\\ndisastrous. It was the major source of income for most farmers.\\'\\'\\n   ``I don\\'t think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought\\nCadillacs and went on vacation in my area,\\'\\' Grindberg added.\\n   A study of the $3.9 billion disaster relief program, conducted\\nby The Associated Press over seven months, found that outside the\\nMidwest drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousands\\nof farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious\\nthan the normal trials of nature.\\n   But money did reach areas Congress most intended to aid,\\nincluding North Dakota, where it kept some farmers on their land\\nand may have prevented some business closures.\\n   ``You might say it kept the state alive,\\'\\' said Fred Selberg,\\nanother farmer in this Red River Valley county. ``Everyone in North\\nDakota in some way or another was helped.\\'\\'\\n   North Dakota, where the drought evoked memories of Dust Bowl\\ndays with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received the\\nmost disaster dollars. More than 49,000 producers shared $410.2\\nmillion _ about 10.5 percent of the total package. Almost all was\\nfor crop loss.\\n   The state, the No. 1 producer of hard-red spring wheat, lost\\ntwo-thirds of its 1988 crop; millions of normally golden acres\\nwithered to pathetic rows of shriveled brown stumps. But drought\\naid cut farmers\\' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a North\\nDakota State University study found.\\n   Disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banks\\nand households from $3.4 billion to $2.1 billion, the study said.\\nEach farm dollar triples as it travels down Main Street into the\\neconomy.\\n   Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without\\ndrought aid, the average farmer\\'s net cash income would have been\\njust $6,300. Drought payments added $15,000.\\n   Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other\\ndrought-ravaged states, including Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and\\nWisconsin. The five states together received nearly half the\\nassistance allocated nationwide.\\n   Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into\\nIowa\\'s economy, an Iowa State University study said.\\n   ``There was no question it was needed to stave off a major new\\nwave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Belt\\nproducers,\\'\\' said Mark Edelman, a university economist.\\n   ``Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short\\nof bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but it\\nprovided a safety net,\\'\\' he said.\\n   It was the same in North Dakota, which has struggled with an\\nexodus of young, educated people, declining revenues, fading small\\ntowns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade.\\n   ``From \\'81 through \\'86, the bottom pretty much fell out of\\neverything,\\'\\' said Greg Schulz, who farms about five miles from\\nGrindberg. Good crops the next two years started to reverse the\\ntrend, but drought stalled the recovery.\\n   ``It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,\\'\\' said\\nDwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist. ``Financial aid helps\\nto alleviate that. The last thing North Dakota needed is more\\nnegatives to push us down.\\'\\'\\n   Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the\\nstate still needs ``a good year to get back on our feet,\\'\\' Hauck\\nsaid. ``We didn\\'t get that in \\'89,\\'\\' he added, referring to\\ncontinuing drought in North Dakota\\'s west and south-central\\nsections.\\n   In fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12\\nmonths ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988\\'s estimated $530\\nmillion, Aakre said. Two reasons why: more acres of wheat were\\nplanted this year, and farmers don\\'t have grain reserves to sell at\\nhigh prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden.\\n   Cass County also had a better 1989 crop but expects higher\\nlosses in crop dollars. And while virtually all farmers here\\nreceived government aid in 1988, far fewer will be eligible a\\nsecond time.\\n   About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms\\nin Cass County, the state\\'s leader in crop acres. Wheat, corn,\\nbarley, soybeans, sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grown\\nhere. Last year, production was 60 percent to 70 percent below\\nnormal.\\n   For Larry Richard, a 36-year-old father of three who farms 1,000\\nacres near the town of Horace, $39,000 in aid, even coupled with\\n$55,000 in crop insurance, amounted to ``just enough to break even.\\nWe were able to cover all our bills. That\\'s all I had really hoped\\nfor.\\'\\'\\n   If that seems like a lot, Richard, who grows wheat, soybeans and\\nbarley, notes it costs him $150,000 for rent, interest, seed,\\nfertilizer, equipment and other necessities.\\n   ``You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is\\ngoing to be,\\'\\' he said. ``Our investment in farming is tremendous\\ncompared to the average businessman. At least they have a commodity\\nto sell. We might not.\\'\\'\\n   Schulz, who farms 6,000 acres, said that without his $100,000\\nmaximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or lay\\noff help.\\n   Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, he\\nsaid, ``I was able to mark time in \\'88. ... Last year we had a\\nbreak-even type of year. This year it was break-even. Next year,\\nwe\\'re going to have to start coming around to a profit.\\'\\'\\n   Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley,\\nwas in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance. His\\n1989 crop was better but still below normal; he expects to get only\\n$3,000 in relief payments.\\n   Grindberg, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mail\\npart-time, thinks the government last year ``pushed he panic button\\non this disaster thing and went too far. In \\'89, they went too far\\nthe other way I think.\\'\\'\\n   ``Disaster aid is political,\\'\\' he said. ``Depending on when you\\nhave the disaster depends on whether they sweeten the pot or not.\\nIf it\\'s an election year ... they all get on the bandwagon.\\'\\'\\n   But Grindberg will persist.\\n   ``As long as the banker says go on,\\'\\' he said, ``next year\\'s\\nalways the best year.\\'\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nHurricane Andrew made landfall late Tuesday night some 60 miles southwest of New Orleans smashing its way through largely rural Cajun country.

Rainfall in the Sahel region of West Africa is the indicator he uses to predict hurricanes. Winds moving across warm ocean air cause updrafts of air bearing sea water that turn into rain clouds. In the absence of moisture, the storms quickly dissipate, but storms gather strength with additional moisture. Comparing yearly rainfall levels in the Sahel with the number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Dr Gray found a striking correlation. Dr Gray said climate changes in the Sahel result from natural weather cycles.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nHurricane activity off the U.S. East Coast will intensify,\\nwarned a weather researcher who reported a new method for\\npredicting Atlantic tropical storms.\\n\\nWilliam Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at\\nColorado State University and a hurricane forecasting\\nspecialist, said he uncovered a strong association between\\nseasonal rainfall in West Africa and the formation of intense\\nhurricanes.\\n\\nBased on the new findings, Mr. Gray predicted earlier this\\nsummer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be above\\naverage, and so far he seems to be right. In July he said\\nthere would be 11 storms severe enough to be named, of which\\nsix would be hurricanes. The National Hurricane Center said\\nthat as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this\\nyear, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal.\\n\\nWeather researchers have been seeking to predict hurricane\\npatterns more accurately as an early warning for coastal\\nresidents of the U.S. and the Caribbean. A sharp decrease in\\nhurricane activity over the past two decades spurred business\\nand residential development that would be vulnerable to\\nincreased hurricane activity.\\n\\nMr. Gray said the West African Sahel region is the newest\\nof five indicators he uses to predict global hurricane\\nactivity. Atlantic hurricanes form from especially strong\\ntropical storms that are triggered by winds and other air\\ndisturbances that sweep across Africa. Wind moving across\\nwarm ocean air causes powerful updrafts of air bearing sea\\nwater that eventually turn into rainclouds. Mr. Gray said he\\nbelieves that in the absence of moisture, these storms\\nquickly dissipate, but that the storms gather strength with\\nadditional moisture.\\n\\nMr. Gray said his research, published in the current issue\\nof Science, suggests that \"intense Caribbean hurricanes\\nGilbert, Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the\\nforerunners of this change.\"\\n\\nComparing year-to-year rainfall levels in the Sahel with\\nthe number of high-powered Atlantic hurricanes, Mr. Gray\\nfound a striking correlation. From 1947 to 1969, for\\ninstance, rainfall in the western Sahel was especially\\nabundant, and during this time there were 13 severe\\nhurricanes that formed in the Atlantic Ocean. From 1970 to\\n1988, the Sahel suffered through a terrible drought, and\\nhurricane activity was unusually low; only one severe\\nhurricane, Gloria in 1985, formed in the area.\\n\\nMr. Gray searched back in recent history and found that\\nthe Sahel, which includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali\\nand Gambia, goes through long periods of alternating dry and\\nwet weather. He found that the Sahel was especially wet from\\n1870 to 1900 and from 1915 to 1935. Hurricane activity was\\nmuch higher during this time than during intervals when the\\nSahel was dry.\\n\\nMr. Gray predicted that, based on historical cycles, the\\nSahel is entering a wet period. He said the drought\\nconditions ended in 1988 and 1989. He based his 1990 storm\\nforecast on the higher-than-normal rainfall in the Sahel in\\nJuly. Mr. Gray said his research suggests that climate\\nchanges in the Sahel don\\'t result from global warming\\nproblems associated with environmental pollution but from\\nnatural weather cycles.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Boston Marathon has a storied past.

Another view is that the Second Amendment provides a solid basis for effective gun control legislation. Justification for this point of view is based on an interpretation of the Amendment\\'s wording in the light of the situation existing in 1792. For purposes of gun control today, it would mean that Congress require owners to register their firearms with the National Guard. This would provide the necessary information concerning owners as required by the Brady Bill and other gun control legislation.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nCongress has been dismayingly inconsistent in its voting\\non gun-control legislation this year, first passing the Brady\\nBill, then moving in the opposite direction by defeating a\\nprovision to ban certain assault weapons and ammunition. But\\nin one respect members of Congress are consistent: they\\ndemand respect for our \"constitutional right to own a gun.\"\\nThey cite the Constitution\\'s Second Amendment and argue it\\nprohibits effective national regulation of the private\\nownership of guns.\\n\\nBut there are strong grounds for arguing that the Second\\nAmendment is no barrier to gun-control legislation. In my\\nopinion, it even provides a solid constitutional basis for\\neffective national legislation to regulate guns and gun\\nowners.\\n\\nThe best clues to the meaning of the key words and phrases\\nare in debates in the First Congress of the United States.\\nThe Members of that Congress were the authors of the Second\\nAmendment. A constitutional amendment calling for the\\nprohibition of standing armies in time of peace was proposed\\nby six state ratifying conventions. Virginia\\'s version, later\\ncopied by New York and North Carolina, brought together three\\nelements in one article -- affirmation of a right to bear\\narms, reliance on state militia, and opposition to a standing\\narmy:\\n\\n\"That the people have a right to keep and bear arms; that\\na well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people\\ntrained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of\\na free state; that standing armies, in times of peace, are\\ndangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided. . .\\n.\"\\n\\nThe purpose was to limit the power of the new Congress to\\nestablish a standing army, and instead to rely on state\\nmilitias under command of governors. The Constitution was\\nratified without adopting any of the scores of proposed\\namendments. But in several states ratification came only with\\nsolemn pledges that amendments would follow.\\n\\nSoon after the First Congress met, James Madison, elected\\nas a congressman from Virginia on the basis of such a pledge,\\nproposed a number of amendments resembling yet different from\\narticles proposed by states. These eventually became the Bill\\nof Rights. In the version of the arms amendment he presented,\\nMadison dropped mention of a standing army and added a\\nconscientious objector clause.\\n\\n\"The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not\\nbe infringed, a well armed and well regulated militia being\\nthe best security of a free country, but no person\\nreligiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to\\nrender military service in person.\"\\n\\nIn this version, \"bearing arms\" must mean \"to render\\nmilitary service,\" or why else would there have to be an\\nexemption for religious reasons? What right must not be\\ninfringed? The right of the people to serve in the militia.\\n\\nThis militia amendment was referred to a congressional\\ncommittee, and came out of committee in this form:\\n\\n\"A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the\\npeople, being the best security of a free state, the right of\\nthe people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; but\\nno person religiously scrupulous shall be compelled to bear\\narms.\"\\n\\nTwo significant changes had been made: first, the phrase\\n\"to render military service in person\" was replaced by the\\nphrase \"to bear arms,\" again indicating that they are two\\nways to say the same thing; second, an explanation was added,\\nthat the \"militia\" is \"composed of the body of the people.\"\\n\\nThe House then debated this new version in committee of\\nthe whole and, surprisingly, considering the subsequent\\nhistory of the provision, never once did any member mention\\nthe private uses of arms, for self-protection, or hunting, or\\nany other personal purpose. The debate focused exclusively on\\nthe conscientious objector provision. Eventually the\\ncommittee\\'s version was narrowly approved. The Senate in turn\\ngave it its final form, briefer, unfortunately more\\nelliptical, and with the exemption for conscientious\\nobjectors deleted:\\n\\n\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security\\nof a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear\\narms, shall not be infringed.\"\\n\\nCertain explanations were lost or buried in this\\nlegislative process: that the right to bear arms meant the\\nright to serve in the militia; that just about everybody was\\nincluded in the militia; and that the amendment as a whole\\nsought to minimize if not eliminate reliance on a standing\\narmy by emphasizing the role of the state militia, which\\nwould require that everyone be ready to be called to serve.\\n\\nBut what about the private right \"to keep and bear arms,\"\\nto own a gun for self-defense and hunting? Isn\\'t that clearly\\nprotected by the amendment? Didn\\'t just about everyone own a\\ngun in 1791? Wouldn\\'t that right go without saying? Yes, of\\ncourse, it would go without saying, especially then when\\nthere were no organized police forces and when hunting was\\nessential to the food supply.\\n\\nBut such facts tell us almost nothing relevant to our\\nquestion. Almost everyone also owned a dog for the same\\npurposes. The Constitution nevertheless says nothing about\\nthe undeniable right to own a dog. There are uncountable\\nnumbers of rights not enumerated in the Constitution. These\\nrights are neither denied nor disparaged by not being raised\\nto the explicit constitutional level. All of them are\\nconstitutionally subject to regulation.\\n\\nThe right to bear arms protected in the Second Amendment\\nhas to do directly with \"a well-regulated militia.\" More\\nevidence of the connection can be found in the Militia Act of\\n1792.\\n\\n\"Every free able-bodied white male citizen\" (it was 1792,\\nafter all) was required by the act to \"enroll\" in the militia\\nfor training and active service in case of need.

The annual Agriculture Department survey released hours later predicted total crop production will be 88% of the 1977 average, with grain production 31% smaller than the 1987 harvest. Corn, the largest and most important American crop, will decline 34% from last year. The soybean harvest is expected to be down 23%, with all wheat production dropping 13%. The department had already predicted that food prices would increase about 4% and believes this drought will add about 1 to 2% more. Food stockpiles, however, remain high and 50 million farm acres are being kept out of production.\\nIntroduction:\\n   An annual Agriculture Department survey\\nconfirmed Thursday that a deadening drought will curtail the fall\\ncorn harvest by a third or more, resulting in higher retail food\\nprices for months and years to come.\\n   However, government officials said bountiful crops in recent\\nyears has built stockpiles so high the United States need not fear\\nactual shortages on grocery shelves and can even continue exporting\\nfood.\\n   The report came hours after President Reagan signed a $3.9\\nbillion relief bill that he acknowledged won\\'t bring rain to crops\\nalready sweltering, but hopefully will help farmers survive to\\nplant again next spring.\\n   The new surveys led USDA experts to predict the 1988 corn crop\\nwill total 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from last year\\'s\\nharvest and the smallest output since 1983.\\n   Sharp reductions also were reported for soybeans, wheat and a\\nnumber of other crops. Cotton, which thrived last month in the hot,\\nhumid weather, is expected to increase from last year.\\n   Overall, the department\\'s Agricultural Statistics Board put\\ntotal U.S. crop production at 88 percent of the 1977 average, a\\nscale used to compare output from year to year. That matched the\\nlow 1983 reading, when sharp cutbacks in government acreage\\nprograms, along with drought, reduced crop production sharply.\\n   The corn crop is expected to average 78.5 bushels per harvested\\nacre, down from 119.4 bushel per acre last year, a record\\nyear-to-year decline of 34 percent.\\n   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American\\nfarmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production\\nof meat, poultry and dairy products.\\n   Assistant Secretary Ewen M. Wilson, the department\\'s chief\\neconomist, said the drought may add 1 percent to the cost of food\\nthis year, 2 percent next year.\\n   ``Today\\'s reports confirm that the drought has had a major\\nimpact on this year\\'s crops,\\'\\' Wilson told reporters. ``But because\\nof large pre-season stocks, total supplies are enough in most cases\\nto assure and adequate food supply at home, satisfy foreign\\ncustomers and meet our food-aid commitments.\\'\\'\\n   Sen.

The July\\nprojection was 1.84 billion bushels\\n   The wheat total included winter wheat planted last fall, which\\nbarely stayed ahead of the drought. Later plantings of durum and\\nother spring wheat varieties were brutalized by heat and dryness.\\n   Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.55 billion bushels,\\ndown 1 percent from last year. But durum and the other spring\\nvarieties, which are produced in the hard-hit northern plains,\\nshowed sharp declines.\\n   Durum was estimated at 54.6 million bushels, down 41 percent\\nfrom last year\\'s harvest, and other spring wheat was shown at 212\\nmillion bushels, down 53 percent from 1987.\\n   Cotton production was estimated at 14.9 million bales, up 1\\npercent from last year.

Other chiefs of police must forsake their own code of silence and condemn Police Chief Daryl Gates. The people of Los Angeles believe that police brutality is common and disapprove of the way Mr. Gates has done his job. The cloud Gates has cast over policing won\\'t be lifted until police chiefs speak out against one of their own.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nThe brutal beating of Rodney Glen King by Los Angeles\\npolicemen offers convincing evidence that a code of silence\\nexists within that department, but it also illustrates a\\nsimilar reluctance of the nation\\'s police chiefs to criticize\\na fellow chief. Four officers took turns kicking and beating\\nan unresisting victim for more than two minutes. These\\ncriminals in uniform would not have dared their brutality had\\nthey feared that any of the 17 other police officers watching\\nwould report their criminal actions.\\n\\nBlatant racist jokes and comments about the beating on the\\npolice communications system make it hard to believe that\\nthis was an \"aberration\" as Chief Daryl Gates claims. The\\nculture of the department that allowed the brutalizing of\\nRodney Glen King was created under Mr. Gates\\'s leadership.\\nYet we, his fellow police chiefs, have for years remained\\nsilent about Mr. Gates, who yesterday was put on a 60-day\\nleave by the Los Angeles Police Commission.\\n\\nA police chief plays an essential role in setting the\\nclimate in which his department operates. Through the years\\nMr. Gates has made public statements clearly at odds with the\\nnew concept of community policing, in which officers work\\nwith citizens to improve neighborhoods and prevent crime. A\\nfew years ago Chief Gates referred to gang members as \"dirty\\nlittle cowards,\" and warned them that \"there is resounding\\napplause to every fall of the hammer.\" The exchange sounded\\nmore like one gang challenging another than a police chief\\nseeking to reduce conflict in the community. Indeed the\\nRambo-like challenge did not lower violence, and may have\\nincreased it. Hundreds of gang homicides occur every year in\\nLos Angeles despite sweeps by the city\\'s police.\\n\\nMr. Gates would have been better advised to seek community\\nprograms for jobs, education, elimination of prejudice and\\nimprovement of neighborhoods. But this kind of reasoning is\\nforeign to a man who publicly claimed that his SWAT team\\ncould free the Iranian hostages.\\n\\nSimilarly, Mr. Gates vehemently opposed the Police Corps\\nProgram backed by other police chiefs. The Police Corps would\\nsend idealistic young people, including minorities, to serve\\na three -- or four -- year tour of duty after college\\ngraduation in return for federal funding of their educations.\\nMr. Gates opposed the Police Corps because its members would\\nnot be professionals. Yet the presence of such\\n\"non-professionals\" would discourage the racism and brutality\\nexposed by the Rodney King beating. Such attitudes survive\\nonly in a closed police culture. The presence of even one\\npolice corps officer witness would have deterred the criminal\\ncops.\\n\\nMany chiefs openly disagreed with Mr. Gates when he\\nopposed the Police Corps Bill in Congress. We should be as\\nopenly critical of his other statements. For example, Mr.\\nGates once said that blacks were more susceptible than\\n\"normal people\" to chokeholds. More recently, he described\\nthe killer of a policewoman as an \"El Salvadoran, who\\nshouldn\\'t have been here.\" The nationality of the murderer\\nwas irrelevant. Mr. Gates\\'s statement did nothing to lessen\\nthe tragedy of the fallen officer, but like his statement\\nabout blacks, it gave comfort to bigots within and outside\\nthe department. And it hardly reduced conflict in a city\\nwhere the majority of the population is made up of minorities\\nwho need and deserve police protection, whether or not they\\nare citizens.\\n\\nTwo years ago, on a national television documentary, Mr.\\nGates defended a special unit that had shot many criminals\\nduring stakeouts. The unit had advance knowledge that crimes\\nwere about to occur, but often stayed outside and let\\nrobberies occur, even though innocent retailers and customers\\nwere put at risk. The chief said that arresting the criminals\\nbefore the robberies wasn\\'t a good idea because the courts\\nwere so lenient. The unit has been allowed to continue to\\noperate despite its high shooting rate -- or, worse still,\\nbecause of the shootings.\\n\\nLast year Los Angeles paid $3 million to 52 residents of\\nan apartment complex ransacked by police. Mr. Gates\\nreluctantly admitted that the officers who did the ransacking\\nwere wrong, but said he could understand their frustration in\\ntrying to fight drugs. Even more recently, Mr. Gates told the\\nSenate that \"casual drug users should be taken out and shot.\"\\nHe assured the senators that he was not being facetious.\\n\\nAnd his initial reaction on television to the Rodney King\\nbrutality tapes was defensive. Mayor Tom Bradley told the\\nmedia that such conduct wouldn\\'t be tolerated, and that the\\nwrongdoers would be sought out for punishment. Mr. Gates said\\nthat while he was shocked, he wasn\\'t drawing conclusions and\\nwould look into the \"background,\" of the incident.\\nPresumably, the chief has now received wiser council. He has\\ncalled for prosecution of three of the officers, and has\\nproduced a videotape for his troops condemning the beating.\\n\\nBut condemnation of misconduct and excessive force should\\nhave been a constant message from the command staff before\\nthe brutality, and not an afterthought. Yet, it\\'s hard to\\nimagine commanders preaching restraint in light of the\\nchief\\'s constant belligerent pronouncements.\\n\\nEven Mr. Gates\\'s apology to Mr. King sent the wrong\\nmessage. He said that he hoped the incident might help Mr.\\nKing to straighten out his life. It is hard to imagine\\nsomeone unlawfully beaten by uniformed officers as others\\nlooked on being inspired to respect law and order. Or was the\\nchief suggesting that the beating was a warning against\\nfurther run-ins with the police?\\n\\nClearly, Daryl Gates\\'s words and actions create doubt\\nabout his claim that the Rodney King incident was an\\naberration. Public opinion polls in Los Angeles show the\\nmajority of people believe police brutality is common, and\\nthey disapprove of the way Mr. Gates has done his job. When\\nhe characterizes such opposition as cop-haters, he embitters\\nhis department and to some extent all police.\\n\\nMr. Gates\\'s military style of policing is at odds with\\nthat in the rest of the country, and it\\'s about time police\\nleaders publicly repudiated it. It is hard to see how the Los\\nAngeles Police Department can regain credibility unless Daryl\\nGates\\'s leave becomes permanent. But the videotape of the\\nLAPD brutality affects the credibility of all police\\nofficers. It has cast a cloud over policing that won\\'t be\\nlifted until police chiefs drop their own code of silence and\\nspeak out against one of their own\\'s peculiar philosophy of\\npolicing.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nSuspected communist rebels on 4 July 1989 killed Col.

They said the blaze resulted in more than $1.1 million \\ndamage to various structures in remote canyons and to the watershed that feeds \\nLake Elsinore. \\n\\nInvestigators said the fire appears to have been caused by people near a \\nroadside store just across the Orange County line, near the crest of Ortega \\nHighway.

A NAFTA rejection would lead to greater protectionism and inflation and slower world economic growth. Inflation is the biggest concern because low inflation has kept bond yields low and boosted shares to record highs. A reverse trend could undermine vulnerable equity markets. Defeat would be bad for President Clinton, who has invested political capital in getting NAFTA through Congress. The outcome of the vote is too close to call.\\nIntroduction:\\njust try explaining what GATT, the Uruguay Round or Blair House are all\\nabout - but US investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the\\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement: if Congress passes the treaty next\\nweek, it will be good for the economy, good for US companies, good for the\\nstock markets, and good for President Clinton.\\nTheir reasoning is quite simple. Investors believe that Nafta will lift\\ncorporate profits because in a more open trading environment between the\\nthree signatory countries the US, with its superior industrial productivity\\nrates and better-quality products, will enjoy the greatest economic\\nbenefits. The expectation is that growth in US exports to Mexico and Canada\\nwill outpace growth in imports from its neighbours to the north and south.\\nInvestors are not alone in their optimistic view of Nafta. Most Wall Street\\neconomists are pro-Nafta, as are the majority of business leaders, if recent\\npolls are to be believed.\\nThere is, however, the dark side of Nafta to consider. What if Congress\\nvotes no? Investors fear that a rejection of Nafta would have dangerous\\nknock- on effects around the world, depressing share prices in the US, Latin\\nAmerica and eventually Europe, and endangering vital trade negotiations over\\nthe Uruguay Round. By coincidence, the day after next week\\'s Nafta vote,\\nClinton will be in Seattle for a trade conference with leaders of Asian\\nPacific Nations. If he arrives there fresh from defeat on Nafta, the\\nPresident\\'s authority on trade issues will be compromised.\\nInvestors\\' darkest fear is that a no vote on Nafta would throw such a\\nspanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of\\ninternational protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic\\ngrowth.\\nIn this scenario, inflation would be the biggest concern of markets. Many\\neconomists argue that the competitive forces unleashed by the accelerating\\ncollapse of international trade barriers have helped restrain global\\ninflation. Low worldwide inflation has kept bond yields at historic lows,\\nwhich in turn have boosted share prices to record highs in many markets.\\nThus, any reversal in that trend - a return of trade barriers, higher\\ninflation, higher bond yields, - could undermine equity markets that are\\nalready vulnerable to a sharp downward correction because of expensive stock\\nvaluations.\\nThen there is the political cost of Nafta\\'s failure to consider. Although\\nthe President inherited the trade pact from his Republican predecessor, he\\nhas invested a lot of his own political capital in getting Nafta through\\nCongress. On paper, this should not be a particularly difficult task,\\nbecause Congress is controlled by Democrats.\\nYet, opposition to Nafta among Democratic legislators beholden to labour\\ninterests is considerable. Anti-Nafta forces have warned that opening up\\ntrade with Mexico will lead to a migration of American jobs south of the\\nborder, where wages are much lower. Because the domestic labour market\\nremains weak, this line has struck a strong chord with ordinary Americans.\\nThe result is that the President faces a tough fight ensuring that the House\\nof Representatives votes to approve the treaty on Wednesday.\\nAs of yesterday, the outcome of the vote was deemed too close to call. Stock\\nmarkets in Mexico and the US, however, believe the chances of success for\\nNafta improved this week. Share prices in Mexico rose on Wednesday and\\nThursday, and US stocks made solid gains, following the televised debate on\\nTuesday between Vice-President Al Gore and Ross Perot, who is Nafta\\'s most\\ncelebrated opponent.\\nGore clearly bested Perot in a heated war of words, and polls taken over the\\nnext few days revealed that more Americans had been won over to Nafta.\\nWhether this helped swing the votes of some anti-Nafta legislators the\\nClinton administration\\'s way remains to be seem.\\nNafta is playing on investors\\' minds because doubts over its passage through\\nCongress have arisen at a vulnerable time for stock and bond prices. A week\\nago bond yields jumped amid worries that resurgent economic growth might\\nrekindle inflation. Although data released this week on producer and\\nconsumer prices showed that fears of rising inflation are, at least for now,\\nunjustified, equity investors remain nervous about rising bond yields.\\nAmid all the doubts over the Nafta, one thing is certain, trading on markets\\nnext week is likely to be hamstrung by uncertainty over Wednesday night\\'s\\nvote, which, like the battle over President Clinton\\'s first budget, will be\\nextremely close.\\n -----------------------------------------------\\nMonday         3647.90    +   04.47\\nTuesday        3640.07    -   07.83\\nWednesday      3663.55    +   23.48\\nThursday       3662.43    -   01.12\\nFriday         3684.51    +   22.08\\n -----------------------------------------------\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nIntroduction:\\nCSO \\n\\nIt is already a multi-million pound disaster for \\nBritish agriculture and now it threatens to erupt into a major \\npolitical row between European governments. It is bovine \\nspongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- \"mad cow\" disease -- and few \\nwould be prepared to say exactly when and where it will end. \\n  Next week European Community health ministers will meet to \\ndiscuss a German call for a ban on British beef imports to that \\ncountry. Some German politicians say their country should risk \\nbreaking Single Market free trade rules because the potential \\nhealth risks are so grave. Nonsense, say British government \\nscientists. \\n  Meanwhile, the controversy in Britain is reaching new \\nheights. Last week, the scientific journal Nature \\ncalled for a start to be made on replacing the British cattle \\npopulation with animals free from the infection -- which the \\nmagazine estimate would cost &pound;30 billion. \\n  Next day, one of the farming industry\\'s loudest voices, the \\nmagazine Farmers Weekly hit back at what it called \"a \\ndiet of speculation, half-truths and downright lies\" and \\ndenounced what it called \"certain publicity-hungry scientists \\npromoted by the media more interested in fiction than fact.\" \\nCalling on the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food \\n(MAFF) to do more to explain the disease, the magazine \\nconcluded: \"The alternative is to exacerbate the current climate \\nof fear and uncertainty...\" \\n  The fear is not just that shared by farmers worried about \\ntheir livelihood. Could it transfer itself from cows to humans? \\n  \"Mad Cow\" disease was probably first observed on a farm in \\nKent in 1985, when four animals were put down after they were \\nobserved drooling, staggering before collapsing. Scientists at \\nthe Central Veterinary Laboratory in Surrey found that the \\nanimals\\' brains had become holed and spongelike -- similar \\nsymptoms to the disease scrapie in sheep and the rare \\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), in humans. \\n  MAFF scientists concluded that BSE had appeared in cattle \\ngiven processed feed that included remains of diseased sheep. \\nNew rendering methods, reducing the temperature at which the \\nfeed was prepared, were enabling the infective agent to survive, \\nthey concluded. Acting on this advice, in July 1988, John \\nMacGregor, then Agriculture Minister, introduced a ban on such \\nruminant protein being used in feed. \\n  Cattle confirmed as having BSE have been put down and \\nincinerated, with the ashes being buried. In 1989 a further ban \\nwas introduced, on cattle offal sold for human consumption. That \\nyear it was officially predicted that 20,000 animals would be \\naffected before the feed ban, together with the drying up of any \\nsupplies already on farms, had its effect. But the spread of BSE \\nhas confounded original expectations. The Ministry of \\nAgriculture said yesterday that by the beginning of last week \\nthe total number of cattle diagnosed since November 1986 as \\nhaving BSE had risen to 121,898 -- six times the original \\nprediction. \\n  The ministry believes that the reason more cattle have died \\nis that farmers or food renderers kept using infected feed after \\nthe ban. Last week, MAFF said that the numbers of confirmed BSE \\ncases in the first two months of this year showed a 20 per cent \\ndrop over the same period in 1993 -- proof, the ministry says, \\nthat the epidemic is waning. \\n  Yet there is still controversy. Some 8,004 cattle have died \\nfrom BSE despite being born after the feed ban was \\nintroduced. MAFF says 5,767 of these were born before the end of \\n1988, and were probably fed from remaining infected supplies. \\n  That theory has been assailed by critics of the ministry. \\nMark Purdey, a Somerset farmer and independent researcher, \\nbelieves that the use of organophosphate pesticides, used from \\nthe 1980s as a sheep dip and to treat warble-fly infestation in \\ncattle, could have damaged the animals\\' immune system, exposing \\nthem to the disease. Ministry scientists, originally dismissive, \\nare now reassessing his theories. \\n  More recently, researchers have suggested that in some \\ncattle, BSE has been \"vertically\" transmitted from cow to calf. \\nGiven a long incubation period, such a possibility could make \\nthe disease harder to eradicate. This month 19 cattle have died \\non farms where MAFF is conducting a seven-year experiment into \\nthe disease. \\n  It is a daunting possibility for the farming industry, which \\nhas responded angrily. \"There is no evidence that this \\ndisturbing disease can be transferred from cow to calf,\" \\nFarmers Weekly insisted last week. More cautiously, \\nMAFF told The Sunday Telegraph: \"We have never said \\nwe have ruled out the possibility of maternal transmission, but \\neven if it occurs, our scientists do not believe it will do \\nanything other than lengthen the time before the disease is \\neradicated.\" \\n  So how long will it be before the epidemic is ended? Richard \\nNorth, a former environmental health officer turned consultant, \\nand a contributor to The Sunday Telegraph, believes \\nthat MAFF\\'s statistics are being skewed to produce more \\noptimistic figures -- claims not surprisingly rejected by the \\nministry. \\n  Mr North said: \"We have more than 8,000 cattle born after \\nthe \\nfeed ban that have subsequently contracted BSE. The claim that \\nall of these are affected by illegally retained infected feed \\ngets less credible by the hour.\" \\n  One question -- perhaps the most important -- remains. If \\nthe \\ndisease has jumped from sheep to cattle -- and cases have also \\nbeen reported in kudu antelope at London Zoo -- could it affect \\nhumans? \\n  That prospect, discounted by most scientists -- including \\nMAFF critics such as Mr Purdey -- is considered a possibility by \\nRichard Lacey, a Leeds University microbiologist who has been \\nstudying cases of CJD, a disease with a long incubation period. \\n  Reviled by the farming industry and privately disparaged by \\nMAFF, he nevertheless insists that there may be a threat. \"I\\'d \\nexpect an increase in cases of CJD by the early years of the \\nnext century,\" he says. \"The bottom line is we just don\\'t know \\nwhat risks we may be running.\" \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nExxon has a revised plan for cleaning 364 miles of Alaskan coastline fouled by the nation\\'s largest oil spill, but the plan is to end in September and would require suspension of local environmental laws. Sludge and tar from the spill fouled beaches of Katmai National Park killing animals and birds and even threatening the huge brown bears. The damage extended southwest of Valdez for some 500 miles. Coast Guard Admiral Yost would decide whether to approve the plan within a week. The oil industry blames the spill for increase in crude prices and higher costs at the gas pumps.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Exxon officials Monday released a revised\\nplan for cleansing 364 miles of Alaskan coastline fouled by the\\nnation\\'s largest oil spill, but said their proposal requires a\\nsuspension of local environmental laws.\\n   The plan makes no provisions for continuing the cleanup beyond\\nmid-September, and notes that 191 miles of lightly oiled coastline\\nmay not be cleaned mechanically at all, but be allowed to be washed\\nnaturally by the environment.\\n   ``It is expected that this will be the case for all lightly\\noiled Gulf of Alaska sites,\\'\\' said the two-part, 60-page report.\\n   ``We are going to have to take a hard look at that,\\'\\' responded\\nBill Lamoreaux, the ranking state environmental official monitoring\\nthe cleanup.\\n   Since March 24, when an Exxon tanker struck a reef outside\\nValdez and poured more than 10 million gallons of North Slope crude\\ninto Prince William Sound, Exxon has financed cleanup crews\\nfighting the spreading sludge. Signs of the spill have been sighted\\nabout 500 miles southwest of Valdez.\\n   The oil company\\'s strategy, which was submitted to state and\\nfederal authorities only hours before a deadline expired, divides\\nAlaska\\'s oil-tainted shores into four categories _ from the most\\nheavily polluted to those that are ``only lightly oiled.\\'\\'\\n   It covers polluted areas within Prince William Sound, as well as\\nthose outside the immediate spill zone, and calls for nearly 3,400\\nworkers to participate in the cleanup.\\n   The worst areas _ three miles of sludge-covered beaches on\\nseveral small islands _ would be targeted immediately, with the\\nothers scheduled for gradual cleansing through Sept. 15.\\n   Exxon\\'s plan calls for the recovered waste to be strained for\\nusable oil that can be refined, and said the oil-laced wastewater\\ncould be treated at the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.\\'s disposal\\nplant in Valdez.\\n   The gunk and sludge that resists treatment or salvage will be\\nburned or buried, according to the Exxon study. Both methods likely\\nwill require exemptions from local environmental laws.\\n   Coast Guard Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., the ranking federal official\\ntracking the cleanup, told reporters in Sacramento, Calif. that he\\nwould decide whether to approve the proposal within a week.\\n   Before the plan was released, Yost said he wanted much more\\ndetail than Exxon\\'s original cleanup plan, which included nothing\\non polluted areas outside the sound.\\n   Yost is scheduled to arrive in Valdez on Tuesday to review the\\nlatest plan.\\n   Meanwhile, tar and sludge from the Valdez spill fouled the\\nbeaches of Alaska\\'s wild Katmai National Park, drenching hundreds\\nof sea otters and birds and threatening the huge brown bears\\nprowling the refuge.\\n   The damage stretches along 260 miles of rocky, rugged coastline\\nsouthwestward from Cape Douglas some 500 miles from Valdez, park\\nsuperintendent Ray Bane said Monday.\\n   ``The oil has made landfall in large quantities in Katmai Bay\\nand Hallo Bay. There is a heavy impact. We have seen several\\nhundred sea otters swimming in oil. The oil has had an impact on\\nvirtually the entire coastline of the park,\\'\\' Bane said.\\n   The 4 million-acre park also is a haven for brown bears, a\\ncoastal cousin of the grizzly. ``A number of bears have been seen\\nwalking in the vicinity of the beaches. We have one verified\\nsighting of a bear walking through the oil,\\'\\' Bane said.\\n   Bane said an aerial survey showed an amorphous oil patch 10\\nmiles wide and more than 20 miles long in the Shelikof Strait,\\nwhich is located along the migration route used by whales.\\n   Exxon is feeling the effects of the spill far beyond Alaska\\nwaters. Several groups throughout the country have called for a\\nboycott Tuesday of Exxon products.\\n   In Anchorage, a group called the Boycott Exxon Alliance has\\nscheduled a rally in front of Exxon\\'s Alaska headquarters.\\n   The attorneys general of Idaho, Oregon and Washington state\\nscheduled a news conference Tuesday to call for a federal\\ninvestigation into the sharp rise in the price of gasoline since\\nthe spill.\\n   The oil industry blames the spill and crude oil prices that have\\nrisen $7 a barrel since January for higher prices at the gas pumps.\\n   Exxon also received sharp criticism from the federal government,\\nwhich accused the company of ``foot-dragging\\'\\' in the construction\\nof a second facility in Seward to aid in the cleanup of sea otters\\nfouled by the oil.

The \"Period of totality\" will last the longest in the town of Tuxpan on Mexico\\'s west coast. Hawaii and Baja are the prime spots because they offer the best chance of cloudless skies. 50,000 to 70,000 sun watchers are expected at each place. Accommodations and transportation to these places are totally booked. Mexican authorities will turn back travelers in the Baja who do not have written proof of accommodations. Airlines may also be very overbooked. This could get ugly.\\nIntroduction:\\nNature stages one of its most spectacular shows on July 11 -- a total eclipse\\nof the sun, one that\\'ll be among the longest this century. And the best\\nviewing spots are virtually in California\\'s back yard: The Big Island of\\nHawaii and the southern Baja California peninsula.\\nUnfortunately, you can\\nprobably forget about seeing it, because, unless you get lucky, you can\\'t get\\nthere from here anymore.  \\n\\nWith some people having booked trips as long as three years in advance,\\nairline seats, rental cars and hotel reservations range from difficult to\\nimpossible to get, travel agents and others report.\\n\"The closer you get to\\nthe event, the less there is\" available, said Paul Kloetzel, president of\\nO\\'Brien Travel Service in San Jose. \"It\\'s an event, and it rarely, rarely\\nhappens. There is a certain element of traveler out there (and) there\\'s an\\nawful lot of those people.\"\\nThe eclipse will be seen from Hawaii to\\ncentral Brazil. If clouds don\\'t spoil the show, viewers along that path will\\nsee the moon slip slowly in front of the sun. The sky will grow darker, as if\\ndusk has fallen, until the sun is completely blocked out for a few minutes as\\nthe moon\\'s shadow falls on the earth. Stars will shine.\\nThe length of this\\n\"period of totality,\" as it\\'s known, will depend on where viewers are along\\nthe path. The eclipse will last the longest -- six minutes and 58 seconds --\\nat the center of the shadow in the town of Tuxpan, on Mexico\\'s west coast. In\\nthe Bay Area, the moon will cover about 55 percent of the sun\\'s surface.\\nAmong fans of the heavens, a solar eclipse inspires awe, fascination and\\ngrandeur. Firm estimates aren\\'t available, but blotted-out-sun watchers are\\nexpected to number more than 100,000 -- perhaps 50,000 to 70,000 in Hawaii and\\nan equal number in Baja.\\n\"The effect of it -- the view of seeing the sun\\ndisappear little by little and then actually having the (blue) sky disappear\\nand having the birds stop singing -- it\\'s miraculous,\" said Irving Hochman, a\\nmember of the San Francisco Amateur Astronomers. \"It really is the most\\nspectacular natural phenomenon possible.\"\\nBob Bruynesteyn, head of the San\\nMateo Astronomical Society, puts it succinctly: \"Not too many people have\\nstood in the shadow of the moon.\"\\nIt\\'s romantic images like these that are\\ninspiring a last-minute surge of would-be eclipse-watchers, travel agents\\nsay.\\nPamela and Daniel Dei Rossi of Campbell were among those scramblers.\\nLearning of the eclipse only a month ago, they began calling travel agents.\\n\"But they basically said they wouldn\\'t even try -- everything was booked,\"\\nsaid Pamela Dei Rossi.\\nThey called places where relatives had stayed in\\nMexico. No luck. She called a friend in Hawaii for a place to stay, but\\nairline ticket and rental car problems still loomed. Then, good fortune\\nstruck. She called a travel agent who had taken a class with West Valley\\nCollege astronomy instructor Tom Bullock. Bullock was leading a group to\\nHawaii, and some late cancellations came up. The Dei Rossis were in.\\n\"We\\nare so excited,\" Pamela Dei Rossi said. \"We had given up.\"\\nThough travel\\narrangements are now tough to come by, some opportunities remain.\\nOne is\\nto go by the back door.\\nHawaii and Baja are the prime spots, because --\\nstatistically at least -- they offer the best chance of cloudless skies. But\\nafter enveloping the Big Island and then slicing across southern Baja, the\\nmoon\\'s shadow will cross the Gulf of California and race across the southern\\nflank of Mexico and down the west coast of Central America. Two of Mexico\\'s\\nbiggest cities, Gaudalajara and Mexico City, lie in the path of totality. So\\ndoes Mazatlan.\\nPuerto Vallarta, a resort city, is only a short distance\\naway. Airline ticket availability is reported spotty for the resorts but still\\navailable for other destinations.\\nAnother possibility is to search around\\nfor groups making the trip that have had late cancellations, as the Dei Rossis\\ndid.\\nWhat probably won\\'t work is the overland route to Baja. From the\\nborder to the northern edge of where the eclipse will be total is about a\\n16-hour drive, said Raul Cardenas, the Mexican consul in San Jose. Mexican\\nauthorities will have a checkpoint from July 7-15 at Guerrero Negro, about\\nhalfway down the peninsula. Travelers who can\\'t produce original documents\\nshowing they have accommodations will be turned back, Cardenas said. Those\\nstaying in private homes must also produce a letter of some kind, he said.\\nEven firm reservations may not be all they seem. Airlines routinely overbook\\nseats, in expectation of no-shows. With the eclipse, there\\'s concern the\\noverbooking could be particularly bad, especially on inter-island flights in\\nHawaii. That\\'s important because many eclipse-watchers haven\\'t been able to\\nbook a flight directly to the Big Island. They\\'ve had to get flights into\\nsomewhere else, like Honolulu, and do a short hop to where they want to be.\\n \"These flights are so overbooked it\\'s actually a laughingstock,\" said\\nO\\'Brien\\'s Kloetzel. \"I have a feeling this is going to be an ugly scene.\"\\nIF\\nYOU\\'RE INTERESTED; An eight-page brochure on the July 11 eclipse is available\\nfor $2 from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 390 Ashton Ave., San\\nFrancisco, CA 94112. Special Mylar viewers for safely observing the eclipse\\nare also available for another $2.  \\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nBritain and France were linked beneath the English Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to connect the two halves of the undersea rail \"Chunnel\". The basic goal of the tunnel is to enable passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours, half the time of a car/ferry journey. A study released last Friday in Paris said the tunnel\\'s completion will aggravate traffic congestion in a wide area of Continental Europe. Some Britons fear an influx of ills from the Continent, ranging from terrorism to rabid animals. Profits are not expected until the end of the century.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Britain and France were linked beneath the\\nEnglish Channel on Tuesday when workers used a two-inch probe to\\nconnect two halves of a 31-mile undersea rail tunnel, officials\\nreported.\\n   Management sources at TransManche Link, the construction\\nconsortium building the ``Chunnel\\'\\' - the Channel Tunnel -\\nconfirmed the historic linkup occurred about 8:25 p.m. when British\\nworkers sent the probe through to French colleagues.\\n   ``It is an example of what Europe is about,\\'\\' British Prime\\nMinister Margaret Thatcher said in London. ``This is Europe in\\npractice.\\'\\'\\n   The linkup fulfills a dream by Napoleon in 1802, who thought he\\ncould defeat the English by connecting Britain to Europe with a\\nland passage. The Chunnel is scheduled for completion in June 1993.\\n   ``This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect,\\nthat Britain is no longer an island,\\'\\' said a construction union\\nofficial.\\n   Eight workers suffered injuries, two seriously, about 90 minutes\\nlater when a tractor towing supplies rolled over on them in a\\nservice gallery, authorities in nearby Sangatte reported.\\n   The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable\\npassengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.\\nThat time is comparable to flying, if transport to and from\\nairports is included, and is half the time of a car-ferry journey.\\n   The conservative Daily Express newspaper noted in its Wednesday\\neditions that Britons would theoretically be able to walk to France\\nfor the first time since the last Ice Age.\\n   The cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of\\n$9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion for\\nunforeseen cost overruns.\\n   The threading of the probes through 100 yards of chalk under the\\nEnglish Channel marks a major turning point in three years of\\ndrilling on the world\\'s costliest tunnel.\\n   The meeting point was just over 13{ miles southeast of\\nShakespeare Cliff, the British terminus near the town of Dover, and\\n10 miles northwest of the French town of Sangatte, near Calais.\\n   The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting\\nfor its total length of 31 miles. Geological conditions account for\\nthe different progress on each side.\\n   French workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their British\\ncounterparts and relayed the news to TransManche officials. The\\nfirst champagne corks popped minutes later.\\n   ``It\\'s an exciting moment. It\\'s the first time we have air\\npassing between the two tunnels,\\'\\' said Gordon Crighton, tunnel\\nengineering manager.\\n   ``We see it as just another exercise, but I\\'m sure there will be\\na lot of parties going on,\\'\\' he said.\\n   Preliminary tests indicated the two halves were 20 inches out of\\nalignment. Another day will be needed to be certain, technicians\\nsaid, but they called the line-up ``exceptional,\\'\\' considering the\\nmassive boring machines are drilling holes about three stories\\nhigh.\\n   The workers will now bore out a one-yard hole to permit passage\\nfrom one half to the other. They are expected to greet each other\\nwith handshakes in a few weeks.\\n   Two Japanese-designed boring machines are drilling the tunnel.\\nAfter it is finished, one will be dismantled and hauled out in\\npieces. The other will drill its own grave and be buried in cement\\nbecause French officials said it will be too costly to extricate\\nit.\\n   A work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding\\nmore pay on the French side appeared likely Monday to stall the\\nlinkup until the weekend or beyond.\\n   But TransManche officials said earlier Tuesday that the meeting\\nin the middle would occur on schedule.\\n   The Chunnel actually consists of three tunnels - two for railway\\ntrains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between them.\\n   Taking into account all the tunnels, 80 percent of the drilling\\nhas been completed by giant, Japanese-built boring machines working\\nfrom Calais and Folkstone, England.\\n   Tuesday\\'s linkup in the service tunnel is described by the\\nFrench as a ``mouse ole\\'\\' - a bore only two inches in diameter.\\n   President Francois Mitterrand and Mrs. Thatcher are expected to\\nmeet each other in the tunnel Jan. 26, after the digging for much\\nof the tunnel is finished. The first coupling of the two rail\\ntunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.\\n   Eurotunnel PLC, the world\\'s largest engineering project,\\nannounced Oct. 8 that it had reached an agreement with its banks on\\n$3.5 billion in new credit.

For each, it was the third successful marathon victory and continues the domination of foreign runners in this marathon. Wakiihuri is a Kenyan who trains in Japan. He bolted away from a pack of runners at 20 miles and was clocked at 2:12:39 at the finish. This timing was the slowest in six years. Panfil\\'s time was 2:30:45, the slowest winning women\\'s time since 1978. The last American winner for the men was Alberto Salazar in 1982. The last woman winner was Miki Gorman in 1977.\\nIntroduction:\\nForeigners continued their domination of the New York City Marathon but the \\nwinners weren\\'t Juma Ikangaa or Grete Waitz. \\n\\nDouglas Wakiihuri, a Kenyan who trains in Japan, was the overall winner and \\nPoland\\'s Wanda Panfil, who lives in Mexico, was the women\\'s winner in Sunday\\'s \\nrace which was plagued by heat and humidity. \\n\\nIt was the third consecutive marathon victory for each. \\n\\nIkangaa, who had captivated New Yorkers last year by winning in course-record \\ntime, and Waitz, who had won the race nine times, each ran fourth in their \\nrespective divisions. \\n\\nFor Waitz, the result was different than anything she had experienced in New \\nYork. It was the first time she had finished the race without winning. \\n\\nSince Waitz, of Norway, ran the marathon for the first time in 1978, no \\nAmerican has won the women\\'s division. The last American women\\'s champion was \\nMiki Gorman in 1977. \\n\\nThe last American men\\'s winner was Alberto Salazar in 1982, when he took the \\ntitle for the third time. \\n\\nKim Jones of Spokane, Wash., finished second among the women for the second \\nconsecutive year, five seconds behind Panfil to make it the closest finish in \\nthe race\\'s 21-year history. \\n\\nPanfil was timed in 2 hours 30 minutes 45 seconds, Jones in 2:30:50. It was the \\nslowest winning women\\'s time since Waitz\\'s 2:32:30 in 1978. \\n\\nWakiihuri, who bolted away at 20 miles, clocked 2:12:39, the slowest since \\nOrlando Pizzolato of Italy won in 2:14:53 in 1984, when the temperature reached \\n79 degrees, the hottest in race history. \\n\\nSunday, the temperature got as high as 72 degrees and the humidity peaked at 66 \\npercent. \\n\\nKen Martin of Dallas, the runner-up last year, failed to finish this time. \\nBothered by a virus for the past two months, he dropped out after 19 miles. \\n\\nThe first American finisher was Gerry O\\'Hara, a 26-year-old New Yorker who was \\n29th in 2:26:15. Mohamed Idris of Brooklyn, N.Y., who finished 22nd in 2:22:23, \\noriginally was announced as the top American, but race officials later \\ndetermined he was an Egyptian citizen. \\n\\nIt was Wakiihuri\\'s first marathon in the United States and the third for \\nPanfil, who did not finish the \\'88 New York City Marathon, after falling near \\nthe 16-mile mark and suffering a bruised ankle. \\n\\nAfter staying with the lead pack for the first 20 miles, the cool, composed \\nWakiihuri took control and pulled away to a 40-second victory over Salvador \\nGarcia of Mexico. \\n\\nIn only seven previous marathons, the 27-year-old Wakiihuri has won the \\'87 \\nworld championship, the \\'89 London Marathon in a personal-best 2:09:03 and the \\n\\'90 Commonwealth Games marathon. He also finished second in the 1988 Olympic \\nGames. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe upcoming Senate hearings on Clarence Thomas\\' qualifications and fitness to serve on the Supreme Court will be a lesson for everyone. His life will be viewed as living proof that a black man from the impoverished South can rise to the heights of the Supreme Court. His supporters say that he is an example of one who relied on the love of his extended family, and worked hard in rising from a humble beginning to a position of prominence. It is anticipated that his detractors will acknowledge that, but will maintain that he was helped along by the same government aid that he would deny to others.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nJudge Clarence Thomas is about to become a lesson. This is\\nrather a burden to put on any man or woman but it is\\ninevitable in his case because he is young, gifted and black\\nand now the center of one great row. His life\\'s story is a\\nmoving one, with its beginnings not in the black bourgeoisie,\\nas Thurgood Marshall\\'s were, but in the hardluck South, his\\nmother a maid, the grandparents who scrimped and saved to put\\nhim in school.\\n\\nA question is which lesson his life best demonstrates.\\nSome say that he is living proof that in America anything is\\npossible, and that\\'s true, and some note his rise to eminence\\ndemonstrates again the progress we have made as a nation in\\nterms of race, and that\\'s true too.\\n\\nBut the lesson that should not be lost is the transcendent\\none: Clarence Thomas made it in America because he was loved.\\nHis mother loved him. And when she could no longer care for\\nhim she gave him to her parents to bring up, and they loved\\nhim too. And they cared enough to scrape together the money\\nevery year to put him in a Catholic school where they hoped\\nthe nuns would teach and guide him and they did. He got love\\nand love gave him pride and pride gave him confidence that he\\nhad a place at the table.\\n\\nThis is something we in the age of\\nthe-family-that-is-not-a-family forget: the raw power of love\\nand how it is the one essential element in the creation of\\nfunctioning and successful people, and how its absence twists\\nthe psyche and the heart. (The children of the mother on\\ncrack are not consigned to lives of uselessness and pain\\nbecause AFDC payments are low; they are so consigned because\\ncrack has broken the maternal bond that brings with it caring\\nand succor.) Lives like Judge Thomas\\'s remind us of this\\nsimple truth.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAnti-NAFTA demonstrators in Virginia said NAFTA undermines the constitution and judicial system by putting decision-making in the hands of international panels. Virginia\\'s tax base would be a concern as companies moved production to Mexico and placed downward pressure on wages.

One undecided congressman, a member of the armed services committee with many military in his district, expected to be influenced by NAFTA\\'s foreign policy implications, but said if offered a decent project he might find it tough to say no.\\nIntroduction:\\nIN VIRGINIA the North American Free Trade Agreement evokes a passionate\\nopposition, but football, apparently, still is the reigning obsession.\\nA \\'not this Nafta\\' rally on Saturday provided little competition for the\\ncollege \\'game of the century\\' - Florida State University against Notre Dame.\\nOnly 115 demonstrators turned out amid the autumn foliage in the grounds of\\nVirginia\\'s capitol in Richmond.\\nThey came promptly at two in the afternoon and by three most were gone. The\\norganisers said they were sending a message to Virginia\\'s three wavering\\ncongressmen that a \\'yes\\' vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be\\n\\'remembered in November\\'. That is, next November\\'s mid-term elections, when\\nthose assembled - mostly followers of Texas billionaires of Mr Ross Perot\\nand union members - would unite to throw the rascals out of office.\\n\\'We are absolutely for free trade,\\' says Mr Bill Diggitt, the state director\\nof Mr Perot\\'s United We Stand. \\'But Nafta undermines our constitution.

Now 29% of the nation is undergoing severe or extreme drought conditions, accompanied by above normal temperatures in much of the nation. The drought involves the northern Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, the Great Lakes region, and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, and may extend into the Mid-Atlantic states. Nationally the drought is about equal to the one in 1911 and somewhat less severe than those in 1956 or several years in the 1930\\'s. However, large areas of the Midwest have had the driest April-June since 1895.\\nIntroduction:\\n   The focus of the drought plaguing much of the\\nnation has shifted eastward, but little relief is in sight for most\\nareas, the National Weather Service reported Thursday.\\n   The new short-range forecast through next Monday calls for hot,\\ndry weather to expand eastward from the Rockies through the Ohio\\nValley to the Mid-Atlantic states.\\n   Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts\\nalong the U.S.-Canadian border, possibly triggering scattered\\nshowers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi\\nValley. The heavy rain which has hit portions of Texas is expected\\nto diminish.\\n   Long-term drought conditions now cover a large area of the Great\\nLakes region and the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the agency\\'s\\nClimate Analysis Center reported.\\n   In addition, drought conditions persist over large areas of the\\nnorthern Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.\\n   A 30-day weather forecast issued Wednesday held little hope for\\nimprovement. And a separate climate assessment added that many\\nareas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent\\nchance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.\\n   At the beginning of July, 29 percent of the nation was\\nundergoing severe or extreme drought, the agency said.\\n   On Tuesday, the Agriculture Department announced sharp\\nreductions in the anticipated harvest of many crops because of the\\nwater shortage _ and those projections were based on the assumption\\nof normal weather from here on, according to department officials.\\n   The new National Weather Service forecasts cast a dark cloud\\nover that assumption.\\n   The drought region now extends well into West Virginia and\\nincludes nearly all of Ohio and Indiana and much of Kentucky and\\nTennessee, the weather service drought advisory said. On the other\\nhand, western portions of the Mississippi Valley have received some\\nrelief due to recent rains.\\n   The drought has been accompanied by higher than normal\\ntemperatures over much of the nation, most notably over the western\\nGreat Lakes region.\\n   The national picture shows the current drought to be about\\nequivalent to that of 1911, and still somewhat less severe than in\\nseveral years in the 1930s or 1956. However, in the Midwest, the\\nweather service reported that large areas have experienced the\\ndriest April-June period on record since 1895.\\n   Recent rains have resulted in local flooding in Texas, but\\nnationally streamflows are below normal, and even in Texas are\\nexpected to fall back to below average levels. Flows in many major\\nrivers remain low and continue to restrict navigation.\\n   Reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation,\\nhowever, the weather service noted.\\n   In addition to Thursday\\'s short-range forecast, the medium-range\\noutlook through July 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain\\nhotter than normal, particularly the Tennessee Valley, lower\\nMidwest, central and northern Great Plains, northern Rockies and\\nGreat Basin. The only areas escaping heat in the forecast are the\\nnation\\'s northwestern and northeastern corners and the\\nLouisiana-Texas-New Mexico area.\\n   Most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal,\\nalthough some significant rain could penetrate northwestward from\\nTexas into New Mexico, Colorado and eastern Wyoming.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nMarathon vacations? Isn\\'t that a contradiction in terms? Not so, says the owner of a company that arranges tours for people who want to take a vacation and run a 26.2-mile marathon at the same time. The tours are arranged to some of the more famous marathon cities, e.g., Boston, London, and Berlin. Entry fees, medical examinations, and other requirements are all included in the tour package. Runners are guaranteed places in marathons. Running in a marathon vacation may not be everyone\\'s cup of tea, but it is a unique way to see a city.\\nIntroduction:\\nTO MOST PEOPLE, marathons and vacations are mutually exclusive. Vacation,\\naccording to Webster, means \"freedom from any activity; rest; respite.\"\\nA\\nmarathon, says the same source, is \"a footrace of 26 miles, 385 yards, run\\nover an open course.\"  \\n\\nBut a unique subset has formed: people who like to do both at the same\\ntime. And to help these folks along, companies arrange tours for marathon\\nvacations. The result? Bangkok in November, London in April and Stockholm in\\nMay.\\n\"Skiers have mountain ranges, tennis players have resorts, why can\\'t a\\nrunner take a marathon vacation?\" said Thorn Gilligan, president of Marathon\\nTours in Boston. \"A runner should be able to enjoy a closed city for a day.\\nIt\\'s a celebration for the sport as much as a competition.\"\\nGilligan took\\n5,500 people last year on 20 tours to countries from Bermuda to Moscow. In\\naddition to air fare and hotel, runners are guaranteed spots in restricted\\nentry races such as the London Marathon. Qualifying times are not required.\\nLondon, the most popular European city to visit, holds the world\\'s largest\\nmarathon (April 12 next year). Berlin\\'s race (Sept. 27, 1992) has grown with\\nthe demise of the wall.\\n\"Most marathons take you through cities, so you get\\na chance to see things you\\'d never see on a sightseeing bus,\" said Fred Lebow,\\npresident of the New York Roadrunner\\'s Club and director of the New York\\nMarathon. Lebow has run in 32 marathons, including London, Paris, Rome,\\nStockholm, Iceland, Seoul and Vienna.\\n\"The most exciting thing is the start\\nof the race,\" he said. \"Each city has something unique.\"\\nThe cities are\\ndifferent, but most marathons include a carbo-loading pasta party the night\\nbefore, medical exams, a post-race celebration, commemorative T-shirts and\\nawards to finishers. Entry fees vary; Brussels is $16, Venice $40.\\nMarathon\\nTours includes the entry price in the package. Going to Bermuda, for example,\\ncosts approximately $900 from San Francisco. The price includes round-trip air\\nfare, four days and three nights at the Grotto Bay Beach hotel (per person,\\nbased on double occupancy), full breakfasts and dinners, a welcome cocktail\\nparty and post-race parties and discounts.\\nEngland has similar\\norganizations: Sports Tours International and Keith Prowse, a company that\\nspecializes in British theater, sports and concert tours.\\nBut it isn\\'t\\nnecessary to run 26.2 miles to go on a running vacation, especially if it\\'s a\\nfamily trip. Some marathons, like Portland\\'s, include additional races: a\\nfive-mile run, a five-mile walk and a kids run. Tel Aviv has a half-marathon\\nand a fun run. Budapest offers a half-marathon and a mini-marathon along the\\nDanube.\\nThere are also trips that incorporate running into the sightseeing\\nschedule. Running coach Pat Savage and Hal Higdon, a senior writer for\\nRunner\\'s World, are taking a group to Ireland in June. The eight-day trip will\\nleave from Chicago and will include sightseeing, guided runs and a fun run\\nfrom Malahide Castle to Swords.\\n\"On a running vacation you plan something\\naround running everyday,\" Higdon said. \"We know the unique scenic routes and\\nput together special runs.\"\\nSome runs are intriguing because of current\\nevents. The Tel Aviv Marathon course went past houses hit by Scud missiles\\nduring the Gulf War. The Belgrade Marathon was held despite Yugoslavia\\'s\\nturmoil. The Munich course is the same as the 1972 Olympic route and finishes\\nin the same stadium.\\nRunning 26 miles just to see a city definitely isn\\'t\\nfor everyone, but at the very least, it\\'s a way to kill two birds with one\\nstone.

People want more representation and this is the impetus behind the momentum for limiting terms of lawmakers. Hunt believes these limits would result in more power going to the unelected staff and lobbyists. Voters should never be prevented from electing who they think is best. Other solutions might be eliminating some of Congress\\' perquisites and a fundamental overhaul of the committee system. Legislators now are put on a committee and stay there, becoming stale and locked into outdated approaches. The length of committee assignments should be limited.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nThe mood in the House majority leader\\'s conference room\\ndarkened with each passing moment as leading Democratic\\ncongressmen heard one of their party\\'s most prominent\\npollsters report what the public thought about them.\\n\\nThe ostensible purpose of the recent session with Peter\\nHart was to discuss the public mood on campaign finance\\nreform. Mr. Hart and a Republican cohort, Douglas Bailey,\\nconducted six focus groups in July in three states --\\nIllinois, Florida and Massachusetts -- to get a deeper\\nfeeling of public opinion.\\n\\nBut as Mr. Hart summarized their findings, the discussion\\nquickly centered on the dismay and disgust many voters feel\\nabout politics and government these days. The reaction in the\\nroom was one of \"deep depression,\" according to one\\nparticipant. Another described it as \"combustible.\"\\n\\nThe Hart-Bailey report found the public \"downbeat\" about\\nthe way the country is going, convinced that Washington\\npoliticians are \"more concerned with political\\nself-preservation\" than with the public good. Average\\ncitizens, the pollsters found, believe they \"simply are not\\nbeing heard in Washington,\" and more and more are losing\\nconfidence in the electoral system as a means of influencing\\ngovernment.\\n\\nAccordingly, these politicians may be in real trouble this\\nyear. The 1990 election offered some early warning signs.\\nTrue, 96% of all incumbents were re-elected. But a few days\\nafter the election, political analyst Alan Baron offered a\\nrevelation: For the first time since World War II the average\\nre-election margin of House incumbents from both parties\\ndeclined from the previous election.\\n\\nNormally, when Republicans have a good year, Democrats\\'\\naverage victory margin declines, and vice versa. But in 1990,\\nvoters declared a plague on both parties\\' houses,\\nunderscoring what polls and other focus groups demonstrate:\\nThe disaffection with politicians isn\\'t ideological. Voters\\ndon\\'t want more conservative or more liberal representation;\\nthey want more responsive representation.\\n\\nThis helps explain the strong momentum for limiting\\nlawmakers\\' terms, a sentiment fueled by the recent\\ndisclosures of the House banking and restaurant fiascos. Term\\nlimits would accomplish few of their proponents\\' goals --\\nmore-independentminded and less-beholden lawmakers -- and\\nwould result in many unintended consequences-far more power\\naccruing to unelected staff and special-interest lobbyists.\\nBut that\\'s of little concern to frustrated voters who are\\nlashing out because nothing else seems to work.\\n\\nPlainly, Congress can best address this frustration by\\ndoing a better job on the issues bothering people-health\\ncare, taxes, jobs. But there\\'s little consensus among either\\npoliticians or the voters themselves on these issues. So\\nprogress will be slow.\\n\\nCongress can make some symbolic moves, however. It can\\neliminate its more indefensible perquisites, such as the free\\nprescription drugs. More important, lawmakers ought to\\noverhaul the disgraceful campaign-finance system to make\\ncongressional elections more competitive, and to reduce the\\nrole of money and influence peddlers in campaigns. Granted,\\nincumbents have little incentive to work against their narrow\\nself-interest. But the threat of term limits or of electoral\\ndefeat focuses even the narrowly self-interested mind.\\n\\nBut there also have to be more fundamental changes in\\nCongress\\'s cozy arrangements. The nexus of many of the\\nproblems -- entrenched arrogance, more concern for powerful\\ninterests than average citizens and the obscene preoccupation\\nwith campaign contributions -- is the committee system. A\\npowerful antidote would be to limit committee service, which\\nwould have few of the political and constitutional drawbacks\\nof term limits.\\n\\nThe case is well articulated by two of the most\\nexperienced congressional observers: Richard Fenno, a\\nUniversity of Rochester political scientist and author of\\nnumerous books on Congress, and Charles Ferris, an attorney\\nwho served as chief counsel to both former Senate Majority\\nLeader Mike Mansfield and former House Speaker Thomas P.\\nO\\'Neill.\\n\\nWhile both men are deeply dismayed at the current state of\\nCongress, they see term limits as a cure worse than the\\nillness. \"Term limits really hit at democracy,\" says Prof.\\nFenno. Argues Mr. Ferris: \"Voters never should be prevented\\nfrom electing a person who they think is the best\\nrepresentative of that community.\"\\n\\nBut they see a lot of virtue in limiting committee\\nassignments. \"This really would challenge these guys to shake\\nup the system,\" says Mr. Fenno, noting that the power of\\ninterest groups is centered in committees. Mr. Ferris\\nbelieves this would \"put a vitality in the system\" while not\\nresulting, unlike overall term limits, in \"a bunch of\\nneophytes who\\'d be more dependent on staff and lobbyists.\"\\n\\nMr. Ferris notes that the current system, in which a\\nlawmaker gets a cherished committee assignment in his first\\nor second term and then stays there for the rest of his\\ntenure, breeds staleness. \"Technology and economics and world\\ndynamics are moving so quickly, but many of these members,\\nwhile very bright, are locked into outdated beliefs and\\napproaches,\" he says. If lawmakers had to change areas of\\nexpertise every three or four terms, \"they wouldn\\'t have the\\nluxury of being intellectually lazy.\"\\n\\nCurrently, the Intelligence committees in both houses and\\nthe House Budget Committee limit members to six or eight\\nyears. Why shouldn\\'t the Commerce committees and the\\ntax-writing and appropriations panels be subjected to the\\nsame limits? Any loss of legislative expertise would be more\\nthan offset by new ideas, new receptivity -- new thinking.\\n\\nThere\\'d be one other incalculable benefit. This would\\ndrive the lobbyists crazy.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nFirefighters in California, Michigan, Montana, Wyoming and Utah battled holiday weekend fires that blackened more than 6,000 acres of forest and wilderness areas.

They press fingers under their noses, dig their knuckles into demonstrators\\' necks, and torque martial arts weapons around their wrists. The police call these techniques \"pain-compliance\". Opponents call them torture. Injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue protesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta. Since then there have been charges of police brutality in San Diego, Pittsburgh, West Hartford, Conn., Boston, and Denver. Last November 15, President Bush signed legislation withholding certain federal grants from cities whose police use excessive force.\\nIntroduction:\\nA controversial videotape being shown among activists nationwide shows Los \\nAngeles police officers intentionally hurting the nonviolent demonstrators they \\nare arresting. \\n\\nThey press fingers under their noses. They dig their knuckles into protesters\\' \\nnecks, and torque martial arts weapons around their wrists. At one point, two \\nofficers twist a woman\\'s arm till she rises from the ground, her face wrenched \\nin agony. In another scene, a young man winces as officers lead him along. His \\narm, contorted behind his back, finally snaps. \\n\\nThe law enforcement name for these techniques is \"pain-compliance.\" Police \\ndepartments nationwide say it\\'s a tried and true way to make uncooperative \\nprotesters cooperate. But opponents call the term a euphemism for torture. \\n\\nDemonstrators have alleged police brutality at least since Freedom Riders \\nlaunched their sit-down strikes in Alabama almost 30 years ago. This time, \\nhowever, the outcry -- including the videotapes of police in action -- comes \\nfrom anti-abortion protesters with Operation Rescue, whose members tend to see \\nthemselves as law-and-order conservatives. \\n\\nAs a result, traditional political alliances have been turned topsy-turvy. \\nSuddenly, some pro-choice liberals are as supportive of the police as \\nconservative hawks were during 1960s demonstrations, while some anti-abortion \\nRepublicans are voicing the sort of \"police state\" rhetoric once associated \\nwith anti-war radicals. \\n\\nIn introducing a measure to limit the police use of force in arresting \\nnonviolent protesters, William Armstrong, Colorado\\'s conservative Republican \\nsenator, decried pain-compliance as \"something we expect to hear about in \\nNicaragua or Nazi Germany -- but not in the United States of America.\" \\n\\nOther conservative lawmakers have echoed his concerns, and on Nov. 15, with \\nlittle media attention, President Bush signed legislation withholding certain \\nfederal grants from cities whose police use excessive force. \\n\\nMeanwhile, police officers, many of whom are sympathetic to the anti-abortion \\ncause, claim that religious zeal -- and perhaps the use of muscle relaxants -- \\nhas given Operation Rescue anti-abortion protesters an unusually high tolerance \\nto pain -- or even a martyr\\'s appetite for it. \\n\\nCaught off guard by an ambush from their conservative allies, police are \\nhowling that the new law -- which could deprive Los Angeles alone of more than \\n$50 million a year in federal aid -- will handcuff them. \\n\\n\"I think it\\'s utter stupidity,\" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said. \\n\"Utter, complete stupidity.\" \\n\\nIn reaction to the uproar, the LAPD is quickly phasing out the term \\npain-compliance, but not the techniques, which have been used \"in civil rights \\ndemonstrations, student demonstrations, Vietnam demonstrations . . . all \\nthrough the \\'60s, all through the \\'70s,\" Gates said. He smiled. \"You didn\\'t \\nhear any Republicans complain then, did you?\" \\n\\nWhile Gates acknowledged that this issue stirs up memories of the controversy \\nabout \"chokeholds\" -- a restraint the LAPD now uses only in life-threatening \\nsituations as a result of fierce public pressure -- he argues that \"come-along\" \\ntechniques, properly used, are the safest, most effective way to arrest \\nnonviolent demonstrators. \\n\\nHis officers, he added, are as well-trained in the use of these holds as any in \\nthe country. \\n\\nOn a recent morning, for example, the Los Angeles Police Academy gym echoed \\nwith the unmistakable sounds of force being exerted, as pairs of recruits, \\ndressed in dark blue sweats, kicked, jabbed, swung their night sticks, or \\ngrappled one another into chokeholds or pain-compliance holds. \\n\\nReacting to one phase of the exam, a woman cadet knocked back an assailant\\'s \\nhand, backed up quickly and leveled her weapon at the man\\'s chest, shouting: \\n\"Put your hands up, lock your elbows, spread your fingers.\" \\n\\nHad this been a real incident, she would have had to decide in a flash of \\nsynapses whether \"reasonable force\" included opening fire with her handgun. \\n\\nDeadly force is one extreme among the techniques officers must choose from in \\nconfronting suspected lawbreakers, explained Sgt. Fred Nichols, the academy\\'s \\nexpert on the use of force. The least forceful tactic is a simple request -- \\n\"Would you do this?\" Pain-compliance techniques fit into the scale above talk \\nbut below the use of a Taser gun, tear gas, and the police baton. \\n\\nAmong the most simple \"come-along\" compliance techniques are twist- and \\nwrist-locks, in which a subject\\'s arm or wrists are manipulated so that soft \\ntissue and nerves press against bone, Nichols said. Another trick of the trade: \\nthe \"mastoid lift,\" in which officers press the nerves along each side of the \\nneck. Demonstrated on recruits who had seated themselves like protesters on the \\nAcademy\\'s playing field, each of these techniques worked promptly. \\n\\nBut while some Operation Rescue demonstrators use a standard civil-disobedience \\ntechnique and \"go limp\" when asked to move, others link arms. They become \\n\"human worm-balls\" and make themselves tense, rendering standard compliance \\ntechniques ineffective, officers say. Trying to carry away protesters in these \\ncases becomes even more dangerous to them and arresting officers, police say. \\n\\nSo LAPD and other police forces around the country, including several in Orange \\nCounty and the San Diego Police Department, began using a modified martial arts \\ntool called a nunchaku -- now termed a \"police control device\" -- consisting of \\ntwo 12-inch lengths of plastic connected by a length of nylon. \\n\\nTo demonstrate, instructors jabbed the device between an arm and the chest of a \\ncadet, and twisted it around in what is known as a \"trap-and-wrap\" maneuver. \\nThe gentlest twist triggered enough pain to make the recruit comply promptly. \\n\\nNichols is puzzled by those who call pain-compliance excessive force, or \\ncompare it to the cattle prods police use in South Africa. Protesters are given \\nevery chance to move on their own. Police actually plead with Operation Rescue \\ndemonstrators in some cases, he said. \\n\\nThen \"they\\'re told they\\'ll be subjected to excruciating pain. It\\'s a pain \\ncontrol technique,\" he said. \"It\\'s going to hurt. That\\'s what pain-compliance \\nmeans.\" \\n\\nBut protesters in Los Angeles and elsewhere assert that the nunchakus and more \\nconventional come-along holds produced not only agony while being applied, but \\nlingering pain, broken bones, torn ligaments, and, in some cases, long-lasting \\nnerve damage. As a result, they have filed lawsuits against police in Los \\nAngeles, Sacramento, Atlanta and other cities. \\n\\nNichols and other officers are suspicious of Operation Rescue\\'s charges. \\n\\n\"The first time pressure is applied, most people fall to the ground,\" Nichols \\nsaid. \"With Right-to-Lifers, you feel something\\'s rotten in Denmark. It\\'s kind \\nof like watching a movie where someone gets shot 10 times and keeps walking. \\nYou say, something\\'s wrong here.\" \\n\\nIn the 25 years that he has been a policeman, Capt. Patrick E. McKinley of \\nLAPD\\'s Metro Division has worked at demonstrations by the Revolutionary \\nCommunist Party and the Jewish Defense League, and at protests for or against \\neverything from apartheid to animal rights. Operation Rescue protesters stand \\nout, he said. \\n\\n\"Pain for many of the demonstrators is a catharsis for past failure to take \\naction against abortion,\" he said in a sworn statement last August, given as \\npart of a court challenge against pain-compliance devices. \\n\\nNichols and others have alleged that some demonstrators simply take muscle \\nrelaxants to increase their tolerance -- a charge an Operation Rescue \\nspokeswoman called \"100% incorrect.\" \\n\\nIn either case, the results are dangerous, said McKinley. \"I\\'m no doctor. But \\npain has a purpose. It\\'s telling you to stop doing what you\\'re doing. If you \\ndon\\'t respond to pain, and it is applied with more force, injuries are \\npossible.\" \\n\\nIn fact, injuries have been mounting ever since police and Operation Rescue \\nprotesters squared off at the 1988 Democratic \\n\\nconvention in Atlanta. As Operation Rescue built momentum, engaging in civil \\ndisobedience at clinics around the country, the allegations of police brutality \\nincreased: \\n\\n* In San Diego, an officer reportedly moved through the demonstrators singing: \\n\"Don\\'t try to understand \\'em, just round \\'em up and brand \\'em.\" \\n\\n* In Pittsburgh, women claimed they were sexually molested by officers. \\n\\n* In West Hartford, Conn., officers removed their badges and name tags -- \\npurportedly to avoid cutting demonstrators -- and then allegedly hauled \\nprotesters away with come-along holds, by lifting them with sharp-edged plastic \\nhandcuffs, or with \"crotch carries\" in which a night stick is stuck between the \\nprotester\\'s legs. A priest testified that the police seemed to enjoy inflicting \\npain: \"The demonic element entered in here.\" \\n\\nA woman arrested this year in Los Angeles said: \"By the time they got my arms \\nall the way back the pain was so intense I was just screaming . . . \\'Jesus! \\nJesus!\\' \" \\n\\nIn demonstrations in those cities and others, including Boston, Atlanta and \\nDenver, protesters alleged that officers continued to apply come-along holds \\nafter demonstrators had complied with their commands, administering pain as a \\nform of \"curbside justice.\" \\n\\nImplicit in the protesters\\' complaints is a sense that they have been betrayed \\nby kindred spirits. \\n\\n\"It wasn\\'t at all like the old anti-war demonstrations where people were \\ncalling the police pigs, being belligerent,\" said Dan Bruno, an accountant for \\nthe city of Orange, whose right wrist was broken at a March 25 Los Angeles \\ndemonstration. \"Frankly, I lead a very middle-class life. I\\'ve never been \\nroughed up like that before. Maybe I just got a little insight into what it was \\nlike to be a black demonstrating for civil rights.\" \\n\\nOperation Rescue has not gone limp after its encounters with police. Rather, \\nleaders began an aggressive letter-writing campaign, encouraging those who felt \\nthey had been abused and people who saw videotapes of the abuse to file \\ncomplaints against the officers, and write to their senators, congressmen, the \\nDepartment of Justice, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. A group called \\nPro-Life Police was formed, and a member testified that he had witnessed \"real \\natrocities\" by the LAPD. \\n\\nBut others said the LAPD had behaved with restraint. For example, feminist \\nlawyer Gloria Allred, never hesitant to criticize official abuses, said she \\nbelieves police acted with professionalism last March, issuing fair warnings \\nand acting only after demonstrators failed to comply. \\n\\n\"I can\\'t have much sympathy for them,\" she said of the anti-abortion \\n\"rescuers,\" as she stood among a vociferous group of pro-choice \"clinic \\ndefenders\" at a Dec. 9 demonstration and counterdemonstration in Fullerton. \\n\"The pain inflicted on women\\'s lives by Operation Rescue people is enormous. \\nWhat they are suffering in pain-compliance is a drop in the ocean compared to \\nwhat we\\'ve endured in exercising our constitutional rights.\" \\n\\nAt demonstrations, throngs of pro-choice demonstrators, some of whom might well \\nhave been on the wrong end of night sticks in another era, watched the police \\ntwist protesters\\' arms and chanted: \"L.A. blue, we\\'re with you.\" \\n\\nChief Gates, an outspoken conservative, does not bask in this new-found \\nsupport. \"I felt like the people in the stands were cheering as we threw the \\nChristians to the lions,\" he said. \\n\\nIn fact, the emotional volatility of the abortion issue has shaken the way many \\nthink in the debate over police uses of force. \\n\\nVillage Voice columnist Nat Hentoff has skewered liberal civil libertarians for \\nletting their ideology stop them from supporting anti-abortion protesters\\' \\nfight to restrain what he calls \"the torture police.\" He also has charged that \\nhis media colleagues have turned their backs on the uncomfortably complex \\nissue. \\n\\nWilliam B. Allen, a controversial Ronald Reagan appointee to the U.S. \\nCommission on Civil Rights, has similar views: \"We like to value tolerance. But \\nyou never know how tolerant you are until you\\'re challenged on something you \\ncare about. This issue has touched some very raw nerves, and we find we\\'re not \\nas tolerant as we pretend to be.\" \\n\\nAt a commission briefing on police brutality charges, organized by Allen in \\nSeptember, Robert McCue, chief of the West Hartford police, defended his \\nofficers. \\n\\n\"I have never heard of training that consists of using stretchers for one class \\nof prisoner and come-along holds for others based on the motivation of a \\ncrime,\" he said. \"All I want my officers to think of at the time that they\\'re \\ntaking somebody into custody is the resistance to the arrest. I don\\'t want them \\nconcerned with abortions, nuclear freezes, saving the whales or whatever.\" \\n\\nEven before the commission met, conservative lawmakers were joining Sen. \\nArmstrong in lashing out against police pain-compliance tactics and pushing \\nlegislation to restrain them. \\n\\nRep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) read into the Congressional Record a column \\nby William F. Buckley Jr. comparing the West Hartford demonstrations to civil \\nrights demonstrations in Alabama three decades ago: \"It is hard to believe that \\nBull Connor, directing white redneck policemen, caused more brutality in the \\ntreatment of blacks than was caused by the police of West Hartford in their \\ntreatment of members of Operation Rescue.\" \\n\\nAn amendment introduced by conservative lawmakers in the House and Senate, and \\ntagged onto a HUD bill later signed by the President, states that no Community \\nPlanning and Development grants may be paid \"to any municipality that fails to \\nadopt and enforce a policy prohibiting the use of excessive force by law \\nenforcement agencies within the jurisdiction of said municipality against any \\nindividuals engaged in nonviolent civil rights demonstrations.\" \\n\\nLos Angeles received almost $56 million in such grants in fiscal year 1989. \\n\\n\"This is what the Democrats used to do all the time, blackmailing cities into \\ndoing what the federal government wants it to do,\" said Gates. \"Now we\\'ve got \\nRepublicans doing it.\" \\n\\nThe Justice Department already investigates charges of police abuse, Gates \\npointed out. But if this \"horrendous\" new measure has its intended effect, \\neliminating the use of painful control techniques in nonviolent demonstrations, \\nhis department may have no choice but to watch as demonstrators of any stripe \\ntake over any facility they choose, he said. \\n\\nCarol Sobel, staff attorney for the Los Angeles Chapter of the ACLU, shares \\nGates\\' assessment that the government acted in this case because conservative \\nlawmakers were sympathetic to the anti-abortion cause. \\n\\nBut, unlike Gates, she believes that using pain-compliance against any \\nnonviolent demonstrator is often \"barbaric,\" and she supports restraints on the \\npolice. \\n\\nSobel was \"amused\" at how quickly lawmakers addressed complaints of police \\nbrutality that, she said, have been raised for years by protesters against U.S. \\npolicy in El Salvador by members of the Revolutionary Communist Party and other \\ngroups generally viewed less sympathetically by conservatives. \\n\\nStill, she believes the new measure will help assure \"that the cost of \\ndemonstrating in this town doesn\\'t escalate. I just hope conservatives remember \\nthat it includes everyone.\" \\n\\nJim Cady in the Times Editorial Library assisted in the research for this \\narticle. \\n\\n* NEW USE FOR OLD TOOL \\n\\nAn ancient Asian farm tool has become a cutting edge weapon for many police \\nofficers in Southern California.

While in California, two new fires flared in over 18,000 acres. In Idaho, a 6,800-acre blaze raced to within a mile of ranches and grain fields and a 7,900-acre fire burned out of control for the 12th day. Meanwhile in Montana, firefighters are battling three large fires burning primarily in wilderness areas covering 208,000 acres, and 173,000 acres burned in earlier fires. Washington, Utah, Wyoming and Oregon combined, have blazes covering close to 1 million acres.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Here is a brief look at forest fire developments in the Western\\nstates:\\n   About 2.1 million acres are smoldering from 30 fires, the\\nfederal Bureau of Land Management said.\\n   Sue Mitchell, a BLM spokeswoman, said there were no active, or\\nflaming, fires and all but a few firefighters have been recalled\\nfrom the blazes.\\n   Two new fires flared Wednesday in the Sierra National Forest,\\none over about 1,800 acres west of Kings Canyon National Park; the\\nother near Mariposa, outside Yosemite National Park. The Mariposa\\nblaze destroyed at least one home and grew to 250 acres.\\n   Fire crews mobilized in the Star Valley of eastern Idaho after\\nthe 6,800-acre Trail Creek fire, fanned by shifting winds, broke\\nthrough a control line and raced to within a mile of ranches and\\ngrain fields. The fire was the most threatening of 17 major blazes\\nburning over more than 70,000 acres. Over 2,500 firefighters,\\nbacked up by National Guard personnel and equipment, were on the\\nlines.\\n   The 7,900-acre Eagle Bar fire near Hells Canyon at the Oregon\\nline burned out of control for the 12th day.\\n   The supply of fresh fire crew members dwindles as workers enter\\ntheir third week of duty. The U.S. Forest Service predicted hot and\\ndry weather well past the Labor Day weekend.\\n   Montana\\'s three largest fires are burning primarily in\\nwilderness areas: the 51,000-acre Canyon Creek fire in the\\nScapegoat Wilderness in northwest Montana; and the 43,000-acre\\nStorm Creek fire and 42,000-acre Hellroaring Creek fire in the\\nAbsaroka-Beartooth Wilderness north of Yellowstone National Park.\\n   The Canyon Creek fire is burning toward several ranches outside\\nthe wilderness, while firefighters are trying to prevent the other\\ntwo fires from burning south into the park.\\n   Gov. Ted Schwinden appealed to the public Wednesday to avoid\\noutdoor recreation over the Labor Day weekend to limit the fire\\nrisk.\\n   The governor said 5,000 firefighters were battling blazes on\\n208,000 acres in Montana, and 173,000 acres burned in earlier\\nfires. He put the cost at $15 million.\\n   Oregon\\'s Department of Forestry announced Wednesday that 3.8\\nmillion acres of private, state and other forest in eastern Oregon\\nwould be closed until further notice due to extreme fire danger and\\nscarce resources to fight new blazes.\\n   Oregon\\'s biggest forest fire, the Tepee Butte fire, has burned\\n36,000 acres of grass and timber on the Wallowa-Whitman National\\nForest and the Hell\\'s Canyon National Recreation Area. The fire is\\nexpected to grow to 59,000 acres before it reaches fire lines.\\n   The Forest Service began training the first of 700 back-up\\nfirefighters to spell weary crews in Oregon and Washington.\\n   Utah firefighters controlled a 525-acre fire near northern\\nUtah\\'s Pineview Reservoir and a 100-acre brush fire in Butterfield\\nCanyon, and expected to control a 60-acre blaze in eastern Utah by\\ntonight.\\n   A forest products company closed 400,000 acres to the public due\\nto fire danger and the U.S. Forest Service banned campfires outside\\ndesignated campgrounds in the Wenatchee National Forest.\\n   Crews cut trails around major fires along the Kettle River Range\\non the Colville Indian Reservation and in Colville National Forest.\\nMore than 1,900 people were assigned to fire lines and mop-up\\nduties in Washington state.\\n   The state\\'s largest fire was burning on the Indian reservation,\\nwhere 9,250 acres of timber and brush have burned. Fires have\\nburned more than 23,000 acres in the state.\\n   The south entrance of Yellowstone National Park may reopen today\\nas winds are forecast to calm.\\n   Firefighters wet down buildings at the Canyon cabin and hotel\\ncomplex and moved brush and dead trees out of the path of the\\n109,000-acre North Fork fire.\\n   Eight fires are burning more than one-fifth of the park\\'s 2.2\\nmillion acres. The largest blaze, the Clover-Mist, grew by nearly\\n40,000 acres to 231,000 acres.\\n   To the south in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, strong winds\\npushed the 42,000-acre Huck fire 7,000 acres to the east Tuesday.\\nBoth the Huck fire and the 112,500 Mink Creek fire also are growing\\nnorth toward Yellowstone.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nWilliam Gray, a hurricane expert, predicts more and fiercer storms in the Atlantic. He expects six this year, average for the last 40 years, but above average for the decade. Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around the equator, and winds for El Nino periods do no allow for predictions of when or where hurricanes will occur. He predicted four in 1987, three actually occurred; four for four in 1986, seven for seven in 1985 five for seven in 1984. Drought in West Africa in the 1970s and 1980s robbed storm systems of moisture needed to escalate storms into hurricanes.\\nIntroduction:\\n   A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in\\nthe Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas,\\nbut says it\\'s impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten\\npopulated areas.\\n   William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado\\nState University, said Friday he expects about six Atlantic\\nhurricanes this year, the average for the last 40 years, but above\\naverage for the decade.\\n   The Atlantic has formed relatively few hurricanes in five of the\\nlast six hurricane seasons. Those years brought just two to five\\nhurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985.\\n   The hurricane season officially begins June 1, and its most\\nactive period usually begins Aug. 1.\\n   Gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annual\\nhurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his first\\nformal 1988 forecast in late May. He issued an early ``outlook\\'\\'\\nFriday for the 10th annual National Hurricane Conference.\\n   ``It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does\\nform in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average\\nhurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season,\\'\\'\\nGray said in a paper presented to the conference.\\n   But Gray said his models of air pressure, winds around the\\nequator and winds for ``El Nino\\'\\' periods, when eastern Pacific\\nwaters are warmer than usual, do not allow for predictions of when\\nor where a hurricane might form.\\n   Gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterly\\nwinds at the equator and the approaching end of ``El Nino\\'\\' period.\\n   Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually\\noccurred. His prediction of four in 1986 was on the money, and he\\noriginally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figure\\nto seven, the eventual correct number, in 1985. In 1984, when there\\nwere five hurricanes, Gray had predicted seven.\\n   Drought in West Africa is responsible for a drop in Atlantic\\nhurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, Gray said. He said the drought\\nhas robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start their\\nescalation into hurricanes.\\n   That pattern eventually will change, he said, ``but it is\\nimpossible to say when this shift will occur.\\'\\'\\n   Forecasters and emergency management officials at the conference\\nstressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during the\\nlull in hurricanes; a surge in storms, up to the levels of the\\n1950s and 1960s, could bring unprecedented damage, they said.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nGrassroots environmental organizations, helped by economic sluggishness and regular corporate layoff announcements, have fanned anti-NAFTA sentiment to its highest level yet. They warn NAFTA will undermine environmental protection work and deny it would create 200,000 jobs in the next 5 years. President Clinton insists global marketplace realities must be faced. President Carter attacked Perot as a rich demagogue, Bush praised Mexican President Salinas, and Ford said immigrants would overrun the US without work at home. Government agencies were instructed to boost NAFTA in public forums. House Speaker Tom Foley says much of what people fear will happen more quickly without NAFTA than with it.\\nIntroduction:\\nGUERRILLA tactics by Greenpeace were swamped by the White House pomp in\\nwhich Mr Clinton and three past US presidents this week endorsed the North\\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement.\\nBut the environmental activists, who momentarily disrupted a House hearing\\nto unfurl a 15 foot anti-Nafta banner, saw their stunt repeated again and\\nagain on evening news shows.\\nWith dozens of similar exploits and clever strategic planning, grassroots\\norganisations have succeed in fanning anti-Nafta sentiment into widespread\\npublic hostility against the pact with Canada and Mexico. A new Wall Street\\nJournal poll, found opposition, at 36 per cent, had reached its highest\\nlevel yet with only 25 per cent of those polled in favour of Nafta.\\nThe continued economic sluggishness and the drumbeat of corporate layoff\\nannouncements have hurt the pact\\'s chances and presented the administration\\nwith a formidable challenge. Fifty per cent of the Americans polled\\ndisagreed with the administration\\'s argument that more jobs will be created\\nthan lost and 54 per cent said that wages would be forced downward so that\\nUS companies and workers could compete with Mexico.\\nPro-Nafta congressmen and senators have been morosely admitting the\\nopposition\\'s success in framing the debate against Nafta as a pact which\\nwould cost jobs.\\nBut they took heart from Tuesday\\'s presidential show: President Clinton\\'s\\npassionate insistence that the realities of the global marketplace be faced;\\nPresident Carter\\'s attack on Mr Ross Perot, the populist billionaire, as a\\ndemagogue with \\'unlimited financial resources,\\'; President Bush\\'s praise of\\nMexican President Carlos Salinas; President Ford\\'s warning that the country\\nwould be overrun by impoverished immigrants from the South if they are given\\nno work at home.\\n\\'It was a revival,\\' said Texas Congressman JJ Pickle. \\'I think Nafta was\\nborn again.\\'\\nTo keep the pro-Nafta case before the public, President Clinton Wednesday\\ntook off for New Orleans and top officials in his administration fanned out\\non speaking tours across the country.

It is believed this process may satisfy some of the Congressional\\ndoubters, who are demanding a \\'level playing field\\' and a speedup of Mexican\\ntariff reductions.\\nPro and anti-Nafta forces are keeping the fax lines burning. A Greenpeace\\nrelease warned that two decades of work on environmental protection would be\\nundermined if the pact is approved.\\nIn response to similar charges by hundreds of grassroots environmental,\\ncitizen and labour groups, Vice president Al Gore, Senator Max Baucus and\\nother lawmakers with green credentials, accompanied by six leaders of the\\nlargest national environmental groups who helped negotiate the environmental\\nside pact, held a briefing to praise Nafta\\'s environmental safeguards.\\nSeemingly unfazed by Nafta\\'s new show of life, the Citizens Trade Campaign,\\none of the umbrella opposition groups, called a press conference to \\'debunk\\'\\nthe Clinton Administration claim Nafta would create 200,000 jobs in the next\\nfive years.\\nUnmindful of a television camera, its leaders plotted new strategies:\\nanti-Nafta resolution in 25 state legislatures; a letter writing campaign\\nand more.\\nNotable by his absence from the fray has been Mr Richard Gephardt, the House\\nMajority Leader, who is said to be close to moving from tentative to\\ncommitted opposition.

A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report notes that the coastal areas from Maine to Texas will experience a 60% growth in population and are ill prepared to handle a hurricane emergency. Predictions of increased hurricane activity are based on studies, atmospheric low pressure waves, and increased rainfall trends in West Africa near the breeding grounds for most hurricanes.

Blacks who alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers--most of them white--of unprovoked beatings, false arrests, intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs. A 55-year-old grandmother testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven white police officers who gave her \"the sign of the Ku Klux Klan\". Mayor Richard M. Daley declared, \"I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in the city of Chicago. Everyone should join together...to help alleviate this problem\".\\nIntroduction:\\n   Two days of racially charged hearings on police\\nbrutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the\\nnation\\'s third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some\\nold wounds.\\n   Richard M. Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by black\\nactivists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late\\nfather, Richard J. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 years\\nbefore his death in 1976.\\n   The younger Daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in his\\nspring campaign, and after defeating black challengers in the\\nprimary and general election, he named minorities to 11 of his 21\\nCabinet positions.\\n   But now Daley finds himself on the defensive. Some black\\npoliticians say the mayor is indirectly sanctioning racism by not\\ndoing enough to stop it.\\n   The racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special\\nhearings called by a City Council committee to look into\\nallegations of police brutality against blacks.\\n   ``There\\'s been no demonstrable change on the part of white\\nleadership in this city to end racism,\\'\\' said Bob Starks, associate\\nprofessor of inner city studies at Northeastern Illinois\\nUniversity. ``It\\'s the same stuff, and it\\'s seemingly getting\\nworse.\\'\\'\\n   But Daley maintains that what\\'s getting worse is ``irresponsible\\npolitical rhetoric\\'\\' from black politicians who are looking ahead\\nto the 1991 mayoral election. Daley is filling the remaining two\\nyears of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city\\'s first\\nblack mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he\\ndied in November 1987.\\n   Daley has denounced the alleged police brutality.\\n   ``I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in\\nthe city of Chicago,\\'\\' Daley said. ``Everyone should join together\\n... to help alleviate this problem.\\'\\'\\n   Also last week, a human relations task force made up of business\\nand civic leaders released a report saying racism in Chicago was\\nfueled by ``a shocking lack of contact\\'\\' between the city\\'s ethnic\\ngroups.\\n   The report, based on a 15-month investigation of the city\\'s race\\nrelations, concluded that racial divisions ``threaten to make\\nChicago an increasingly unpleasant place to live and are\\nantithetical to the city\\'s economic growth and prosperity.\\'\\'\\n   At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who\\nalleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers\\n_ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests,\\nintimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.\\n   Among them was a 55-year-old grandmother, Callie Bryant, who\\ntestified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven\\nwhite police officers who gave her ``the sign of the Ku Klux Klan.\\'\\'\\n   Two teen-age boys testified that in August they were picked up\\nby white officers, roughed up, and then dropped off in a white\\nneighborhood where they were attacked by white youths.\\n   The poice department\\'s record was defended by Police\\nSuperintendent LeRoy Martin, a black appointee of Washington.\\n   ``I\\'m the head of this police department, and if this police\\ndepartment is bad, it\\'s because I\\'m bad as superintendent,\\'\\' Martin\\nsaid. ``When this police department is attacked, I must defend it.\\nWhen it\\'s wrong, I must correct it.\\'\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nJohn Kelley is in training for his 60th Boston Marathon. The 83-year old icon of the marathon world is the object of attention for his endurance. The 26- mile, 385 yard course will claim many a runner but Kelley hopes to finish the grinding course as he did last year. Kelley is a medical wonder and he continues to confound the experts over his physical condition. Originally he started running after work 60 years ago in order to relax and began entering the Boston Marathon. He won in 1933 and 1945 and was a runner-up seven times. Experts predict that, even at the age of 83, he will finish ahead of most of the 13,000 other runners entered in the race.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nEAST DENNIS, Mass. -- It\\'s 5:30 a.m., an icy rain is\\nfalling from an indigo sky, and there\\'s a stiff northeaster.\\nThis Cape Cod country road is deserted, but for the sweaty\\nsilhouette of John Kelley.\\n\\nBounding up a hill in his thin green Windbreaker, with\\nsand from the beach blowing into his face, Mr. Kelley shouts\\nover the howling gale: \"This isn\\'t too bad, you know,\" he\\nsays, though the wind chill factor is about 20 below.\\n\\nMr. Kelley is in training for the Boston Marathon -- his\\n60th Boston Marathon. And even at the age of 83, he probably\\nwill finish ahead of a large number of the 13,000 runners\\nexpected to compete -- officially or unofficially -- on April\\n15.\\n\\nBill Rodgers, a four-time Boston Marathon winner who plans\\nto run again this year, marvels at Mr. Kelley: \"It\\'s\\nincomprehensible that a man his age is doing what he\\'s doing.\\nI\\'m struggling at the age of 43. . . . This isn\\'t golf.\"\\n\\nEven the thought of running a course of 26 miles and 385\\nyards leaves some of Mr. Kelley\\'s rivals of yesteryear\\ngasping. \"Aghast is more like it,\" says Leslie Pawson, 86, a\\nthree-time Boston champion who ran against Mr. Kelley half a\\ncentury ago. \"My doctor says: `No running, whatsoever.\\' I\\ncan\\'t even remember when I ran my last marathon.\"\\n\\nJohn Adelbert Kelley is a throwback to a time when\\nmarathoners did it for glory and cab fare. A two-time winner\\nin Boston (1935 and 1945) and runner-up seven times, Mr.\\nKelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year\\n-- as he has been for 15 years.\\n\\nMr. Kelley is such an institution that Hopkinton, Mass.,\\nwhere the race begins, has made him an honorary citizen.\\n(\"That means I don\\'t have to pay taxes there,\" he jokes.) Two\\nstate troopers will run alongside the 5-foot-6, 130-pound Mr.\\nKelley into Boston so he won\\'t be trampled by \"groupies,\" as\\nhe calls them, clamoring to shake his hand. Last year, five\\nJapanese runners were waved away by the bodyguards, as they\\nsidled up to the old celebrity during the race. Recalls Suni\\nTomomitsu, one of the runners: \"At first we thought, `Oh,\\nwow, he\\'s like Mafia man.\\' Then we said, `Oh no, this is nice\\nJohnny Kelley.\\' In Japan, he is awesome.\"\\n\\nThough he isn\\'t the oldest person ever to enter the Boston\\nMarathon, Mr. Kelley is the oldest to run it. Peter Foley,\\nwho was born in 1859, was a regular until he was well into\\nhis 80s. But he walked the course. Starting at dawn (six\\nhours before the official noon start), Mr. Foley would\\neventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight.\\n\\nOf course, Mr. Kelley -- not to be confused with the other\\nJohn Kelley, who won the Boston Marathon in 1957 -- isn\\'t the\\nrunner he was in 1935 when he won the race, in 2 hours, 32\\nminutes, 7 seconds. His best time ever was in 1945: 2 hours,\\n30 minutes, 40 seconds. Last year he finished in 5 hours, 5\\nminutes. He hopes to do better in 1991. \"That\\'s not a\\nprediction, just a goal,\" he says.\\n\\nWhen John Kelley first toed the line in 1928, George Bush\\nwasn\\'t yet in kindergarten, Joe DiMaggio was an unknown and\\nNike was the winged goddess of victory, not a running shoe.\\nIn those days, Mr. Kelley recalls, he ran in black leather\\nhigh-jumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razor\\nblade. \"I would have loved to run with the worst pair of\\nsneakers on the market today,\" he says.\\n\\nBack then, the sport didn\\'t have much of a following.\\nToday, of course, the Boston Marathon is a big deal, covered\\nby TV from start to finish and offering $402,000 altogether\\nin prize money.\\n\\n\"The winners get a medal and $55,000,\" says Mr. Kelley. \"I\\ngot a medal and beef stew. God bless them,\" he adds. \"They\\ndeserve it.\"\\n\\nThe rosy-cheeked, supple Mr. Kelley is a medical wonder.\\nEach year, he visits the Cooper Clinic at the Aerobics Center\\nin Dallas for a battery of endurance tests. \"Physiologically,\\nwhatever that means, I got all A\\'s,\" Mr. Kelley reports of\\nhis checkup four months ago.\\n\\n\"What that means,\" explains Kenneth Cooper, the physician\\nwho wrote \"Aerobics\" and several sequels and is now at work\\non a book on elderly athletes, \"is that Johnny has the body\\nof a man 23 years younger. He\\'s going to be one of the stars\\nof my book.\" Mr. Kelley\\'s resting pulse rate -- 60 beats a\\nminute -- is well below the average person\\'s 72 beats.\\n(That\\'s good.) On the stress test the clinic gives, Mr.\\nKelley holds the endurance record for his age group.\\n\\nA mechanic for Boston Edison Co. before he retired in\\n1972, Mr. Kelley started running in the evenings after work\\nmore than six decades ago. His only purpose was to relax and\\nhave some fun. \"All day long, I did what my boss told me to\\ndo,\" he recalls. \"But when I ran at night, I felt free. I ran\\ntill I was exhausted.\"\\n\\nIn 1928, when he was 21, he entered his first Boston\\nMarathon but didn\\'t finish. He dropped out three-quarters of\\nthe way through the race. Then, in 1933, he finished 37th in\\na field of about 200 runners. In all the years since, he has\\nmissed the race just once, in 1967. (He has competed, all\\ntold, in 112 marathons, including the 1936 and 1948 Olympics.\\n\\nMr. Kelley well knows the jagged course from Hopkinton to\\ndowntown Boston:\\n\\nThe first challenge comes five miles into the race, where\\na set of little hills can get a psyched runner to waste\\nenergy charging up the slopes. A mile and a half later,\\nthere\\'s new reason to beware: The smells of Cavanaugh\\'s\\nBakery can set off hunger pangs.\\n\\nAn Exxon station in Wellesley marks the halfway point. A\\nsteep descent into Newton Lower Falls can jar a tired\\nrunner\\'s bones. Then, at the end of a long column of oak and\\nmaple trees, is Heartbreak Hill, his nemesis. It cost him at\\nleast two victories, he says. And finally there\\'s the Haunted\\nMile, a stretch where many runners have collapsed. Boston\\'s\\nskyline, 2 1/2 miles in the distance, can seem so far away.\\n\\nThough still going strong, Mr. Kelley acknowledges the\\nmarathon gets tougher each year. To compensate, he trains\\nharder. He used to start preparing in earnest at the end of\\nJanuary. \"In recent years, I\\'ve been in training 12 months a\\nyear,\" he says, though the serious stuff -- a daily one-hour\\nrun, sprints on the track and long, 2 1/2-hour runs every\\nother week -- begins in December. (He doesn\\'t count the miles\\nhe puts in, as many long-distance runners obsessively do, but\\nhe says he wouldn\\'t object to an estimate of about 50 miles a\\nweek.)\\n\\nMr. Kelley always trains at 5 a.m., and alone: \"It\\'s a\\nquiet time, no traffic; the air is fresh and sweet.\" His\\nroutes vary. In January, he prefers the frozen sands of the\\nbeach. With the approach of spring, he takes to the alder and\\nscrub-pine hills and bluffs where the sun can be seen rising\\nover Cape Cod Bay. After his morning run, he spends a couple\\nof hours painting (still lifes and Cape Cod scenes), a hobby\\nhe took up about 25 years ago.\\n\\nUnlike many runners, Mr. Kelley doesn\\'t bother with\\nstretching exercises before he runs in the morning. \"This is\\nmy warm up: I empty the dishwasher, I set up the coffeepot,\\nbut I don\\'t plug it in. I set up the breakfast table. Then I\\ncheck the outside temperature to see what clothes to wear.\"\\nHe and his wife, Laura, live in a two-bedroom ranch-style\\nhouse here in East Dennis, with more than 350 trophies,\\nmedals and sweat-stained marathon numbers scattered about. He\\nisn\\'t particular about brands of shoes (\"I wear them all\") or\\nwhat he eats (\"I never eat broccoli, but I love steak and ice\\ncream.\")\\n\\nMr. Kelley aims to run till he is at least 100 years old.\\n\"He\\'s a strange man,\" says Laura Kelley, in awe of her\\nhusband\\'s vigor. The 82-year-old Mrs. Kelley adds, \"I just\\ntry to stay in his shadow, but I have a hard time even doing\\nthat.\"\\n\\nIn a rare moment of reflection, Mr. Kelley explains what\\nmakes him tick: \"I paint because I like it. I run because I\\nlike it. If for some reason I don\\'t finish the marathon, I\\ndon\\'t owe an apology to anyone. But I\\'ll tell you, the Boston\\nMarathon -- with all those people waving -- is better than my\\nbirthday.\"\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nOfficials in California\\'s San Francisco Bay area have identified 10 local areas that seem to have the greatest potential for a firestorm. Collectively, there are many community problems that cause firefighters great concern: a preponderance of wood homes; shake roofs; winding, steep or narrow roads; dense vegetation; mix of dense homes and dry forest; weak bridges; few fire stations; longer fire alarm response times; limited or uncertain water supply; gridlock from fleeing residents; failure of residents to comply with fire codes. Firefighters complain overall that moving into wooded seclusion and natural beauty exacts a cost in fire protection.\\nIntroduction:\\nSteep hillsides covered with trees and dense brush. Narrow, winding roads.\\nWood homes with shake roofs. Uncertain water.\\nThe conditions are familiar\\nto South Bay firefighters, who know they may be no more than a careless match\\naway from a blaze as intense and unpredictable as the one that devastated the\\nOakland hills last Sunday.  \\n\\nNow, in the wake of that firestorm, local firefighters are looking up at\\nthe hills that surround this area and wondering not whether, but only when and\\nwhere.\\n\"I know it\\'s there,\" said Saratoga Fire Chief Ernest Kraule. \"Every\\nfire chief -- there\\'s 12 of us in this county -- knows it\\'s there.\"\\nThe\\ndanger is in the Saratoga foothills, where Kraule\\'s department has battled\\nnine deliberately set fires since June -- most recently Oct. 19, the same day\\nOakland firefighters thought they had contained a brush fire that a day later\\nblossomed into the deadly firestorm.\\nIt\\'s in the mountain communities that\\nstraddle Highway 9 in Santa Cruz County, isolated by weak bridges that won\\'t\\nsupport some firetrucks and connected by a two-lane road that will hinder\\nescape.\\nIt\\'s in Los Altos Hills, where residents in 1984 repealed an\\nordinance requiring fire-retardant roofs; a year later, a fire destroyed 100\\nacres and 12 homes, many of which have been rebuilt -- with the same flammable\\nshake roofs.\\nIn fact, the danger of an Oakland-like inferno is in almost\\nall of the hills that ring the South Bay, where homes often are surrounded by\\ndense brush or stately trees, the fuel of rapidly spreading wildfires.\\nAnd\\nthe risk is increasing, as cramped Bay Area residents push farther into the\\nhills and canyons in search of living space and rural atmosphere. State\\nofficials say it\\'s no coincidence that six of California\\'s 10 most damaging\\nwildfires have occurred since 1980.\\n\"The tendency is to have bigger fires\\nthat are much more expensive to put out, with much more property loss,\" said\\nRoy Pike, a deputy chief in the California Department of Forestry and Fire\\nProtection\\'s Santa Rosa office.\\nPrivacy\\'s high price\\nHaving pushed into\\nthese areas, city dwellers don\\'t understand that the wooded seclusion and\\nnatural beauty exact a cost in fire protection, rescue workers complain.\\nIn\\ncities, a firetruck might respond to an alarm within two or three minutes; in\\nthe Highway 9 communities, they hope for 10 minutes. Instead of an eight- or\\n10-inch water main ensuring pressure for fire hoses, the mountains are laced\\nwith two-inch pipes.\\n\"Those are the risks you take when you live in an area\\nlike this,\" said Dean Lucke, chief of the forestry department\\'s San\\nMateo-Santa Cruz ranger unit. \"We can\\'t guarantee everyone\\'s safety up here at\\nall times.\"\\nIn general, firefighters say, the heavily wooded Santa Cruz\\nMountains are more susceptible to major fires than the grass-covered eastern\\nfoothills. Take the 1985 fire above Lexington Reservoir, which blazed for six\\ndays, scorching nearly 14,000 acres and destroying 42 homes.\\nBut there are\\nexceptions, such as narrow Kilkare Canyon near Sunol, where 200 homes are\\nstrung along a narrow, five-mile dead-end road that empties onto narrow,\\nwinding Niles Canyon Road.\\n\"A large concentration of vegetation, heavy fuel\\nloads, lots of wooden structures, ingress-egress (problems), lack of water,\\nthey\\'re all there,\" said Fremont Fire Chief Dan Lydon, whose department would\\nbe one of the first called to a fire in Kilkare. \"If there\\'s an area that has\\nthe significant potential for disaster, that\\'s one.\"\\nCodes rarely enforced;\\n  In the hills, nearly every home is surrounded by thick brush or dense woods.\\nFire codes require residents to keep the trees 30 feet from their homes, but\\nfire officials admit they rarely enforce them. Instead, as they drive by, some\\nfirefighters make mental notes about which homes would be worth saving.\\n\"You do this evaluation of what you think you\\'d be effective at salvaging,\"\\nsaid Don Shaw, a battalion chief for the Palo Alto Fire Department. By not\\ntrimming dense brush, he said, some homeowners are \"virtually signing a death\\nwarrant.\"\\nAnd increasingly, fire officials worry about wildfires spreading\\ninto even more heavily populated areas at the base of the foothills, where\\nnumerous trees create an \"urban forest.\"\\n\"We could have a fire going from\\nrooftop to treetop to rooftop to treetop in any number of areas in this city,\\nif the weather conditions are right,\" said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Osby.\\nThe lesson of the Oakland hills, firefighters say, is to contain and\\nextinguish even the smallest fires as quickly as possible. But, often, that\\nmeans firefighters have to overcome narrow roads, weak bridges, inadequate\\nwater pressure and gridlock from fleeing residents.\\nChallenge for\\nfirefighters\\nMany of the South Bay\\'s most vulnerable areas -- such as\\nRedwood Estates above Los Gatos and Emerald Lake Hills above Redwood City --\\nbegan as colonies of summer homes, a handful of secluded cottages strung along\\nnarrow winding roads. Now, these communities are the year-round home for\\nthousands, often still dependent on volunteer firefighters and an overtaxed\\nnetwork of roads and water lines.\\n\"On a good day, trying to maneuver fire\\napparatus on those roads is tough,\" said Steve Cavallero, a battalion chief\\nfor the Redwood City Fire Department, which covers a portion of Emerald Lake\\nHills. \"Combine that with panic, with people getting out of the way, and\\nyou\\'re setting the stage for disaster.\"\\nAn estimated 25,000 people live in\\nthe communities along Highway 9 between Santa Cruz and Boulder Creek, the\\ncurvy, two-lane road that would be the only way out in the case of a major\\nfire. How would all those people escape?\\n\"That\\'s a good question,\" said\\nO.J. Burrell, chief of fire prevention at the San Mateo-Santa Cruz ranger\\nunit.\\nWeak bridges keep firetrucks out of many of those communities, as\\nwell as New Almaden Valley south of San Jose, forcing firefighters to carry\\nhoses by hand. Ed Ekers, chief of the Santa Cruz city fire department, worries\\nabout sending his trucks through \"a tunnel of fire\" if flames were ever to\\nspread across the canopy of trees above Highway 9.\\nWill there be water?\\nEven if they can reach a blaze, firefighters know there may not be any water\\nto fight it. In Oakland, water pressure dropped as electricity failures shut\\noff pumps and thousands of open hydrants and water connections quickly drained\\nreservoirs.\\nThat could happen even in urbanized areas of Santa Clara County\\nbecause the major water suppliers rely on a similar system of electric pumps\\nto maintain water pressure in the foothills. \"We would face the same\\nsituation,\" said Sharon Whaley, spokeswoman for the San Jose Water Co., which\\nserves foothill areas in Los Gatos, Saratoga and Almaden.\\nIn rural areas,\\nwater supplies are even chancier. In the east foothills and southern Santa\\nClara County, homeowners have to provide only 5,000 gallons for firefighting,\\nbarely enough for five minutes at the rate some firetrucks pump.\\nTo Mike\\nBalesteri, chief of the forestry department ranger unit in Santa Clara County,\\nthe lesson is simple: \"It\\'s either bring your own water or find your own water\\nin our game.\"\\nTaps would go dry quickly\\nEven when rural communities have\\nupgraded their water systems -- as Redwood Estates did -- firefighters say the\\ntaps would start to run low if three or four houses were burning at once.\\nLocal officials say they try to limit fire hazards largely by restricting\\ndevelopment in the hills. But many of the most dangerous areas were built long\\nbefore modern planning ordinances and building codes.\\nAnd for every\\ncommunity, like Saratoga, that requires fire-retardant roofs, there are\\nothers, like Los Altos Hills, unwilling to suffer even that inconvenience.\\nSeven years later, the Los Altos Hills revolt against fire-retardant roofs\\nstill resonates in the mind of Los Altos Fire Chief Dick Landrum, whose\\ndepartment is charged with protecting the area.\\n\"Every time my fire marshal\\nstarts to talk about amendments to the . . . building code, they say, \\'Don\\'t\\neven bring it up,\\' \" Landrum said.\\n\"I would hate to say it, but I\\'d\\nanticipate another Oakland.\"  \\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nResults of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine show that individuals infected with the AIDS virus, especially drug users, are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis. Only about 10 percent of the general populace who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ever develop the disease, but the risk is much greater for those who carry the latent tuberculosis bacteria and then contract AIDS. Not only are they at greater risk themselves but, because tuberculosis is more easily passed on than AIDs, they can transmit it to health care workers, caseworkers and others.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Drug abusers who are infected with the AIDS virus\\nand tuberculosis bacteria should be treated with medicine to prevent\\nfull-blown TB, says a study published today.\\n   Doctors have noticed a growing prevalence of tuberculosis in\\nrecent years among people at high risk of AIDS, especially drug\\naddicts.\\n   In the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine,\\nthe TB usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis\\ninfections, not new exposures to the bacteria, in people who also\\nare infected with the AIDS virus.\\n   The doctors warned that besides being at risk of getting\\ntuberculosis themselves, AIDS-infected addicts who carry the TB\\nbacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with, to health\\ncare workers and other people.\\n   ``The aggressive identification and treatment of HIV-infected\\nintravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is\\ntherefore of both clinical and public health importance,\\'\\' wrote Dr.\\nPeter A. Selwyn of Montefiore Medical Center in New York.\\n   People may carry either the AIDS virus or tuberculosis bacteria\\nfor many years without getting sick. While most people with the AIDS\\nvirus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome,\\npeople who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only\\nabout a 10 percent life-long risk of getting TB.\\n   HIV _ the AIDS viurus _ weakens the body\\'s defenses against\\ndisease. The study suggests that it lowers resistance to the\\ntuberculosis bacteria, putting people at much higher risk of TB.\\n   The study was conducted on 520 drug users who were in a methadone\\nprogram. When the study began, 42 percent already were infected with\\nHIV. Twenty-three percent of those with HIV also carried TB bacteria\\nas did 20 percent of those who were free of the AIDS virus.\\n   During almost two years of followup, active tuberculosis\\ndeveloped in eight of the AIDS-infected people, but in none of those\\nwho did not have HIV. Seven of the eight TB cases occurred in people\\nwho were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before the\\nstudy began.\\n   The doctors noted that 13 people who carried HIV and TB bacteria\\nwere treated with the drug isoniazid, and none of them went on to\\nget active tuberculosis. However, seven of 36 people with both\\ninfections who did not take the medicine got TB.\\n   The doctors said that the drug is now administered along with\\ndaily methadone doses at the clinic where the study was conducted.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nFor two months last summer, residents of the northeastern corner area of Yellowstone National Park were threatened to be burned out by forest fires. Eventually, millions of dollars, thousands of man-hours, and an early autumn snowfall saved the area. The unprecedented fire season burned nearly 1.5 million acres in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, including 705,000 acres within the National Park, causing residents to worry about what is happening beneath the snow this winter. Reportedly, some wildfires have buried themselves in roots of trees and grasses and smoldered all winter, only to pop up through the snow in the spring.\\nIntroduction:\\n   The new year ushers in a new wildfire\\nseason, an unwelcome thought to the residents of this small Montana\\ntourist town on the northeastern corner of Yellowstone National Park.\\n   For two months last summer the citizens of Cooke City and its\\ntiny suburb, Silver Gate, were showcased on the nightly TV news and\\nsplashed across the front pages of the nation\\'s newspapers as forest\\nfires threatened to burn them out.\\n   Pinched between the Storm Creek and Clover-Mist blazes, an\\nestimated 150 seasonal residents and dozens of tourists were\\nevacuated twice while hundreds of firefighters faced down walls of\\nflame which threatened annihilation. Eventually, millions of\\ndollars, thousands of man hours, and an early autumn snowfall saved\\nthe towns.\\n   No structures were lost within the towns\\' boundaries, but seven\\nresidences and five outbuildings were destroyed in the area.\\n   One wag even changed the sign leading into town by adding a\\nsingle letter, rechristening it ``Cooked City.\\'\\'\\n   Their economically critical summer tourist season a bust and the\\nhunting season crippled, the folks of Silver Gate and Cooke City\\nstraggled home in mid-September to pick up the pieces.\\n   ``The first thing most people around here did was go on\\nvacation,\\'\\' said Patti Smith, owner with her husband, Bob, of the\\nBearclaw Service and Cabins, a gas station and small motel. ``The\\nfire really took a toll on a lot of folks.\\n   ``Business was way down this fall because we didn\\'t have the\\nhunters, but we got a lot of curious weekenders from Cody and\\nBillings who wanted to see how bad it was.\\'\\'\\n   The Smiths, who own the only photocopy machine for 30 miles in\\nevery direction, found their small gas station and convenience store\\na mecca during the fires. The U.S. Forest Service, which coordinated\\nsome of its firefighting efforts from Cooke City, set up shop near\\nthe photocopy machine, and everybody who had information or was\\nseeking some crammed into the Smiths\\' log cabin office.\\n   ``It was crazy for a while,\\'\\' said Mrs. Smith, 33. ``We got sent\\nout twice.

Former Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood left jail in New York after a judge cut his bail from $500,000 to $25,000.\\nIntroduction:\\nBacked by public antipathy toward the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster, Gov. \\nSteve Cowper on Thursday threatened to close down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline \\nunless its owners meet his terms for improved safety and cleanup measures. \\n\\nAt the same time, it was disclosed that federal officials are probing the \\npossibility that Exxon\\'s 987-foot oil tanker was on autopilot shortly before it \\nran aground and that the electronic navigation aid confused the crew and \\ncontributed to the accident. \\n\\nAfter meeting personally with top executives from three of the seven oil \\ncompanies that own the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. earlier in the week, Cowper \\nasked them to respond by noon Thursday to his six-point safety plan. \\n\\nAs the deadline approached, the three companies -- ARCO Alaska, BP America and \\nExxon USA -- responded with a six-page list of ideas. An aide to the governor \\ndescribed the companies\\' response as \"generally OK\" but said that Cowper may \\nissue an order putting his plan into effect anyway. \\n\\nIn one proposed draft of an order, continuation of routine operations at the \\nAlyeska Marine Terminal near the town of Valdez is described as creating \"a \\nsubstantial potential risk of additional oil spill\" because the consortium has \\nfailed to demonstrate it can manage a large spill with minimal environmental \\neffects. \\n\\nTo reduce the risk, the order, which could be issued as soon as today, would \\nrequire: \\n\\n -- A written description, due within 72 hours of the order\\'s being signed, of \\nthe location of all oil-spill gear at the consortium\\'s disposal. Equipment must \\nbe dedicated to oil-spill cleanup only. \\n\\n -- The names of 12 oil spill-response team members who do nothing but respond \\nto oil spills and who are available for such duty 24 hours a day. \\n\\n\\nInstallation of Booms \\n\\n -- The installation of containment booms around all oil tankers in the harbor. \\n\\n -- Permanent restriction of tanker traffic to daylight hours. \\n\\n -- A limit of one tanker being loaded at a time until all designated cleanup \\nequipment is in place, and the end of all loading within 72 hours if cleanup \\nequipment is not ready. \\n\\n -- Demonstration by April 30 of adequate gear and supplies to handle another \\n10-million-gallon spill. \\n\\nFailure to comply with the emergency order would carry penalties that range \\nfrom fines to criminal prosecution and jailing of company officials. \\n\\n\"We want the oil industry to be ready for a spill of this magnitude if it \\nhappens tomorrow,\" Cowper said. \"There is going to have to be a plan that \\nsatisfies us, our people, and it will be tough. If it isn\\'t complied with, we \\ndon\\'t have any remedy available to us except shut down the terminal.

Such a move would swiftly halt oil \\nproduction in the state, and worsen supply problems in the lower 48 states. \\n\\nIt also would badly pinch the state treasury, which relies on oil taxes and \\nroyalties for 85% of its income. Cowper said he would seek special legislation \\nto tap Alaska\\'s $10-billion Permanent Fund, a kind of super budget reserve, \\nshould any terminal shutdown last long enough to cause short-term funding woes \\nfor the state. \\n\\nEven if Cowper\\'s shutdown were found to illegally interfere with interstate \\ncommerce and be overturned in court, it could last long enough to drive home a \\npoint about improving cleanup response plans. \\n\\nThe Alyeska companies\\' offer included the immediate start of random drug and \\nalcohol testing on board ships and the continued use of two-tugboat escorts \\nbeyond Bligh Reef, the shallows into which the Exxon Valdez crashed March 24 \\nbefore leaking 240,000 barrels of oil into ecologically sensitive Prince \\nWilliam Sound. \\n\\nAlyeska also suggested expanding the Coast Guard\\'s radar system, which had been \\nscaled down as a cost-saving measure in the early 1980s, and offered to keep on \\nhand additional equipment to contain, skim and disperse spills. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the chairman of Exxon Corp. told Congress Thursday that the third \\nmate who was on the bridge of the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground has told \\ncompany lawyers that he turned off the ship\\'s automatic pilot in an effort to \\navoid the reef. \\n\\n\"My understanding is that he turned that computer off and it was not as if it \\nhit the rocks on automatic pilot,\" Exxon Chairman Lawrence G.

Heat and humidity, as well as strong winds, sapped the strength of the runners, however. Paul Davies-Hale, and Englishman and Lisa Weidenbach from Washington state both held back in a conservative race, saving their energy for the last few miles. Davies-Hale\\'s winning time was 2:11:25, the second slowest in this marathon\\'s history. Weidenbach\\'s time was a very respectable 2:28:15. Weather conditions for the race were poor, with temperatures in the mid-60\\'s, 53 percent humidity, and strong winds. Forty degree temperatures with cloud cover are ideal.\\nIntroduction:\\nMother Nature conspired against this struggling marathon Sunday, serving up \\nbalmy, windy weather and wilting both the men\\'s and women\\'s fields. \\n\\nTemperatures during the Old Style/Chicago marathon hovered in the mid-60s, with \\n53% humidity. The heat sapped the strength of most runners, giving the patient \\nand steady runners a distinct advantage. Among the men, Paul Davies-Hale of \\nEngland proved the most patient, winning in a rather pedestrian 2 hours 11 \\nminutes 25 seconds, in his first marathon ever. \\n\\nIt was the slowest winning time in this race since 1982. \\n\\nAmong the women, Lisa Weidenbach of Issaquah, Wash., repeated as champion, with \\na personal best of 2:28:15, impressive under the circumstances. \\n\\nIt was the second-hottest race in Chicago history, only 1978 was worse. By \\ncomparison, last year\\'s race was 30 degrees cooler at the start. Most distance \\nrunners prefer temperatures in the 40s, with cloud cover. \\n\\nThe race conditions were simply more bad luck for the 12th running of Chicago\\'s \\nmarathon, which has been fighting for respectability since losing its sponsor \\nin 1986 and staging no race in 1987. After a week of summer-like weather, race \\norganizers hoped to be salvaged by a good race; to have, if not impressive \\ntimes on this flat and fast course, at least a memorable race. \\n\\nThat developed, at points, Sunday, as about 8,000 runners started at Daley \\nPlaza downtown and wended their way through city streets. A pack of five men \\ntook off fast, maintaining a 2:09 pace at nine miles. \\n\\nThose early leaders: El-Mostafa Nechchadi of Morocco, Don Janicki of Colorado, \\nGerardo Alcala of Mexico, Carlos Montero of Spain and Gabriel Kamau of Kenya. \\n\\nThey did the early work against the wind, while a second pack hovered 20 \\nseconds behind. The lead pack went through the half-marathon at 1:04:50, a pace \\nthat would wither in the second half. No one who was in the lead pack at the \\nhalfway point, with the exception of Montero, finished in the top five. \\n\\nDavies-Hale had been among those who had cagily stayed back, going with a more \\nconservative approach. \"I was concentrating on running five-minute miles,\" he \\nsaid. \\n\\nHe accomplished that, almost exactly. His time works out to 5:00.8 mile splits. \\n\\nDavies-Hale caught the second pack at 13 miles and met up with pre-race \\nfavorite Steve Binns, who lives 30 miles from Davies-Hale in England\\'s West \\nMidlands. The two quickly went in different directions -- Binns falling back \\n(he eventually dropped out) and Davies-Hale moving up. \\n\\n\"I asked Binnsie who was in the first group, he told me, and I went,\" \\nDavies-Hale said. \\n\\nAt 22 miles, Davies-Hale was in the lead and in control, running smoothly and \\nnot appearing to labor under the bright sun. Following him, and likewise \\npicking off the fading runners in the first pack, were Ravil Kashapov of the \\nSoviet Union, who was second in 2:13:19, and David Long, also from the British \\nMidlands, who was third in 2:13:37. Ed Eyestone was the first U.S. finisher in \\nfourth, 2:14:57. \\n\\nIn the women\\'s race, Weidenbach had not been the favorite and she agreed with \\nthat handicapping. \\n\\n\"To be honest with you, I was afraid of Cathy (O\\'Brien),\" she said. \\n\\nWith reason. O\\'Brien, a 22-year-old from Boston, has been on the verge of a \\nbreakthrough for a long time. She took off in Sunday\\'s race with authority and \\nran with a 20-30-second cushion for 15 miles. Then, the heat from the sun and \\nthe perceptible heat of Weidenbach constantly gaining did her in. \\n\\nAt 18 miles, Weidenbach came up on O\\'Brien, her New Balance teammate. They \\nshared some water, then Weidenbach tossed aside the water bottle and put on a \\nsurge that left O\\'Brien flat. \\n\\nIt was the same spot, the corner of Wells and North Avenue, that Weidenbach had \\ntaken the lead in last year\\'s race. It was also where dozens of her family \\nmembers and friends were posted. \\n\\nCarla Beurskens of the Netherlands, at 37 still an amazing runner, eventually \\npassed the struggling O\\'Brien and placed second 2:30:24. O\\'Brien was third in \\n2:31:19. \\n\\nGiven the heat, the humidity and the wind, Weidenbach\\'s time might have been as \\nmuch as two minutes faster. Even the 2:28 is respectable -- only five U.S. \\nwomen have run under 2:30. \\n\\n\"I guess when you are having a good day, nothing is going to get you down,\" she \\nsaid. \\n\\nDavies-Hale, a former plumber from Rugeley, Straffordshire, seemed bemused by \\nthe attention and nonplussed that he had just won $50,000 in prize money. About \\nas far as he seemed willing to go, on the celebrity scale, was to say he had \\npitched the plumbing job. \\n\\n\"I\\'ll still do the odd washing machine . . . good rates,\" he said. \\n\\nDavies-Hale, 27, came to the United States in 1985 and settled in Boulder, \\nColo., the nation\\'s unofficial running center. Davies-Hale may have shown a \\nliking for running in heat when he won the Boulder Bolder that year in terrific \\nheat. \\n\\nHe was a 1984 Olympian in the steeplechase and, on the advice of others, moved \\nup to 5,000 and 10,000 meters. \\n\\nStill, Davies-Hale is unsure what his future in the marathon is. Like his \\nfellow countrymen, he\\'s low-key and practical and not interested in \\nspeculating. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve already had a great track season,\" Davies-Hale said. \"I may run another \\nmarathon next year . . . but I really want to get back on the track.\" \\n\\nMarathon Notes \\n\\nRace organizers insist that this race is at a world-class level, especially \\npointing to the world\\'s richest purse. That may be so, but all major marathons \\nhave drug testing and Chicago has none. Race director Tim Murphy said the race \\nwas not selected by The Athletics Congress, which governs the sport, to conduct \\ntesting. . . . Men\\'s and women\\'s winners won $50,000, second place won $30,000 \\nand third place $20,000. . . . Scot Hellebuyck won the men\\'s wheelchair race in \\n1:45:30. Ann Cody Morris won the women\\'s wheelchair race in 1:58:51. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nSlovenia\\'s stocks shot up with its secession from Yugoslavia on June 25, but then slumped with unease about the future. The European Community hesitates to recognize Slovenia and Croatia, for whom it brokered a peace plan, for fear of encouraging its own minorities. Slovenia is used to being considered prosperous and Western and is disillusioned at feeling poor and shunned. Slovenia needs to find new markets to replace Yugoslavian markets, which purchased a quarter of Slovenia\\'s goods. Exports need to double to match European standards. A major motivation behind Slovenia\\'s independence was to free itself from the \"Yugoslav risk\" that discouraged foreign investment.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nLJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia -- As federal army tanks and jets\\npounded the breakaway republic of Slovenia last week, the\\npin-striped brokers of the Ljubljana Stock Exchange defied\\nair-raid dangers and gathered in their sixth-floor trading\\nroom. It was one of their best days ever.\\n\\nBonds issued by the besieged republic traded briskly and\\nclimbed to records. A full 100% of the corporate stocks --\\nall two of them -- held steady or rose. The price of vouchers\\nto obtain foreign exchange jumped 10%, even though Slovene\\nbanks had stopped issuing foreign currency.\\n\\nYesterday, with a tenuous peace settling over Slovenia,\\nthe exchange panicked. Slovenia bonds slumped. No one touched\\nthe stocks. The foreign exchange rights went begging.\\n\\n\"There is a certain logic to this,\" says Drasko\\nVeselinovic, the exchange\\'s chief executive. \"Slovenes are\\nnow beginning to see the costs of independence more clearly\\nthan when we were at war.\"\\n\\nThe two million people of this picturesque Alpine republic\\nare waking up from their two-week nightmare sobered by the\\nimplications of their intoxicating declaration of secession\\nfrom Yugoslavia on June 25. Their bravado is undiminished,\\nreflected in the almost unanimous feeling that there can be\\nno going back now that blood has been spilled in defense of\\nindependence. But there is also a growing unease about going\\nforward, because no one knows where Slovenia is headed.\\n\\nFor the moment, the Slovenes are feeling lonely,\\nunrecognized by the nations of the world. Their considerable\\ntrade with the rest of Yugoslavia, which helped make them the\\ncountry\\'s richest people, is vanishing. Their identity is\\nbeing turned upside down; once known as Yugoslavia\\'s\\n\"developed north,\" Slovenia will now be lumped together with\\nWestern Europe\\'s \"underdeveloped south.\" Nationalism\\novershadows pragmatism, a quality that once distinguished\\nSlovenia from the rest of the often bewildering Balkans.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve decided to be our own country,\" says Mr.\\nVeselinovic, \"but we really don\\'t know how we will execute\\nit.\"\\n\\nThe Balkanization of this Balkan country has also become\\nEurope\\'s worst nightmare. Almost every country on the\\ncontinent has its own disenchanted minorities, from the\\nSoviet Baltics to French Corsica, that could be encouraged by\\nthe independence declarations of Slovenia and the neighboring\\nrepublic of Croatia. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has held\\nup recent events here -- the Yugoslav army assault on\\nSlovenia and the bitter ethnic clashes between Croats and\\nSerbs -- as a warning to his land of what can happen when\\nnationalism fractures a country.\\n\\nWhile the European Community is counting on the peace plan\\nit brokered to defuse tensions (it calls for a three-month\\nperiod of negotiations in Yugoslavia), most governments\\nconcede that the country\\'s breakup is inevitable. But the\\nWest Europeans also are wary of moving toward recognition of\\nthe various pieces.\\n\\n\"We have every sympathy for small peoples who aspire to\\naffirm their national identity by democratic methods,\" the\\nSwiss foreign minister reportedly told a European conference\\non national minorities. \"But that doesn\\'t mean we can accept\\nthe unilateral alteration of frontiers.\"\\n\\nThis shunning by Western Europe, and the U.S., is\\nparticularly disillusioning for a people who enjoy their\\nBMWs, Peugeots and Fiats, their shopping trips to Munich and\\nVenice and their vacation chalets in the Alps. The Slovenes,\\nfrom their days in the Austro-Hungarian empire, have always\\nconsidered themselves to be Westerners.\\n\\nNestled between the Alps and the Adriatic, Slovenia became\\nthe most prosperous patch of communist Europe. The per capita\\nannual income of nearly $7,000 is 10 times that of the\\nsouthern regions of Yugoslavia. But as Slovenes measure\\nthemselves with Western Europe, it is they who are the poorer\\ncousins.\\n\\nJoze Mencinger, an economist and former finance minister\\nof Slovenia, illustrates the republic\\'s economic resilience\\nby noting that while Yugoslavia\\'s industrial output fell 18%\\nso far this year, Slovenia\\'s declined only 10%. When reminded\\nby a visitor that Austria, in contrast, is posting robust\\ngrowth, he grows somber.\\n\\n\"Okay, we must realize that we will be the less-developed\\npart of Europe,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, in times of\\ntransition like this, people\\'s expectations are often wrong.\\nEverybody expected that we could become Austria and\\nSwitzerland overnight.\"\\n\\nOver a decade might even be too soon. Slovenia\\'s exports\\nof assembled cars, pharmaceuticals, refrigerators and\\nfurniture account for a third of the total value of the goods\\nand services it produces. But Slovene economists reckon that\\nexports would have to double to match the performance of\\nother small European countries. Slovenia is counting on\\nexpanding its already extensive ties with Austria (a joint\\nventure between Austrian and Slovene companies recently\\ncompleted a high-tech Alpine tunnel opening another border\\ncrossing) as well as courting more business with its other\\nold Austro-Hungarian partners, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.\\n\\nBut what Slovenes dream of is one day being admitted to\\nthe EC. \"It\\'s not size that makes a country successful,\" says\\nJosip Skoberne, head of the international division of the\\nSlovene Chamber of Economy, citing EC-member Luxembourg, far\\nsmaller in population and area than Slovenia. \"It\\'s your\\nability to engage in international trade that makes you\\nviable.\"\\n\\nFinding new markets in the West is all the more urgent\\nwith the certain decline in Slovenia\\'s trade with the rest of\\nYugoslavia. A quarter of all goods produced in Slovenia are\\npurchased by other Yugoslavs, and Slovene leaders counted on\\nmaintaining these ties even after declaring independence. But\\nthe recent fighting, they believe, ended all hope of economic\\nunion.\\n\\n\"Unbelievable,\" scoffs Mr. Skoberne as he reads a letter\\ntelefaxed from the council of Banja Luka, a town with a large\\nSerbian population in the province of Bosnia-Hercegovina,\\ndecreeing that all Slovene-owned assets in the city are to be\\ninventoried and frozen.\\n\\nOne of the major motivations behind Slovenia\\'s\\nindependence grab was to free itself from the \"Yugoslav risk\"\\nthat hampered most attempts to attract foreign investment.\\nNow, Mr. Skoberne and others worry about an emerging \"Slovene\\nrisk.\" At the stock exchange, Mr. Veselinovic frets that his\\npost-independence plans to trade in gold, commodities and\\nforeign currencies are jeopardized by the uncertainty\\nengulfing Slovenia.\\n\\n\"We had been getting a lot of interest from abroad, but\\nthey won\\'t invest now while things are so unsettled,\" he\\nsays. \"But this is only logical.

While the program did assist farmers in the upper Great Plains who needed it, AP found that the election year payments went far beyond. Congress added hail and flood damage to the package, and loose regulations and lax enforcement further spread the money. By November, one- quarter of all American farmers, some of whom enjoyed good crops at higher prices, had collected damage money. AP found some growers got drought aid and crop insurance payments, and then replanted for a successful harvest. Some payments went to banks, corporations, churches and even local governments.\\nIntroduction:\\n   America\\'s 1988 drought captured attention\\neverywhere, but especially in Washington where politicians pushed\\nthrough the largest disaster relief measure in U.S. history. The\\nAssociated Press went back to track where the $3.9 billion went and\\nfound the money spread far beyond the drought.\\n   The record $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988, hailed\\nas salvation for small farmers devastated by a brutal dry spell,\\nbecame much more _ an unexpected, election-year windfall for\\nthousands of farmers who collected millions of dollars for nature\\'s\\nnormal quirks.\\n   An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found the\\ndrought relief bill paid cash to farmers for everything from\\nhail-damaged kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in\\nMassachusetts, rain-bloated tomatoes in New Jersey and washed-out\\nbird seed in Colorado.\\n   Payments went far beyond the initial intent to save Midwestern\\ngrain growers from bankruptcy, an effort _ supported by almost\\neveryone _ that simply grew and grew and grew.\\n   At each step, the program was broadened. Congress began with a\\nbill to aid drought victims. The lawmakers added hail to the relief\\npackage. Then floods.\\n   Next came ``heat,\\'\\' an addition from the Agriculture Department.\\n   By the time checks were being written at the county level, the\\nAP found, fellow farmers elected to locally administer federal\\nagriculture programs were approving claims for such common perils\\nas insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even ``ineffective\\nherbicide.\\'\\'\\n   None of those conditions should have been ruled eligible,\\nadministrators in Washington say. Nothing in federal procedures,\\nhowever, requires paperwork to be forwarded to higher officials for\\nroutine approval or checking.\\n   By the end of this October, about one-quarter of all U.S.\\nfarmers had collected on damage to most of 506 eligible crops and\\njust about any kind of weather peril in 49 states. The taxpayers\\'\\ntab ran to $3.9 billion.\\n   ``We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north,\\'\\'\\nsaid Travis Turnipseed, a Levelland, Texas, cotton farmer who\\'s had\\nhail damage 23 out of the last 28 years, but collected cash for the\\nfirst time in 1988.\\n   Loose regulations and lax enforcement of them were the major\\nreasons for the government generosity, the AP found by examining\\nfederal records in 14 states through the Freedom of Information Act.\\n   The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought\\nreceived _ a steady bombardment of print and electronic images of\\nshriveled cornstalks and cracked, dusty fields _ played key roles\\nin rushing through the nation\\'s largest ever disaster relief\\nmeasure.\\n   ``Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to\\nfarmers,\\'\\' said Dan Otto, a professor at Iowa State University.\\n``(The politicians) were trying to get recognized as a friend of\\nagriculture.\\'\\'\\n   In the end, drought relief became a one-time bonus for thousands\\nof farmers in parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed\\ngood crops at higher prices and wouldn\\'t have qualified as disaster\\nareas, including parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas,\\nOklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey.\\n   Although some producers appeared to have violated eligibility\\nrequirements _ exceeding the allowed gross annual income, for\\nexample _ their requests for aid were approved anyway by local\\nofficials. Most farmers simply took advantage of a generous\\nprogram. As tough as farming is, they\\'d be fools not to take what\\nwas offered, they said.\\n   ``It was there, so I took it,\\'\\' said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and\\ncorn farmer in the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because\\nhail and Russian wheat aphids damaged his 1,265-acre irrigated\\nfarm, which grosses $300,000 to $400,000 a year.\\n   Government officials say they did the best they could with a\\nrushed program. Loopholes were tightened in 1989\\'s smaller $1\\nbillion drought relief program.\\n   ``Some farmers just got grandfathered in, that\\'s true,\\'\\' said\\nDan Shaw, deputy administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization\\nand Conservation Service, which administers payment programs for\\nthe Agriculture Department. ``What percentage, we don\\'t know. But\\nthat is part of the beast I guess that was created. Whenever you do\\nthis for the whole nation, there are some people that luck out.\\'\\'\\n   The AP found some farmers who did better than just luck out.\\nThose growers profited by ``triple-dipping\\'\\': reaping crop\\ninsurance as well as drought aid on damaged crops, then replanting\\nthe same ground for a successful harvest _ all perfectly legal\\nunder the 1988 program.\\n   Disaster payments in several states also went to banks,\\ncorporations, investment firms, churches and even local governments\\nsuch as the city of Littlefield, Texas, despite regulations\\ndesigned to match benefits to small farmers.\\n   In several cases, corporations ineligible for drought relief\\nbecause of the bill\\'s $2 million cutoff on gross annual income\\ncollected anyway because they owned a stake in a farm.\\n   Santa Fe Pacific Co., the railroad giant with annual revenue of\\n$3 billion, received a check through its energy division. The\\nAmerican Cancer Society got a check, as did a unit of Texas A&amp;M\\nUniversity and the mid-Atlantic headquarters in Baltimore of the\\nJesuit order.\\n   Pryslak Farms of Great Meadows, N.J., a $9 million-a-year\\nproduce, garden and truck farming operation, collected $100,000 for\\nlosses on endive, escarole and leaf lettuce because the local\\nAgriculture Department official said he thought the $2 million\\nceiling applied to just the vegetable operation.\\n   Wrong, say Washington officials _ the ceiling applies to revenue\\nfrom all operations.\\n   Despite all the apparent misapplications of aid, the program did\\nprovide crucial assistance to farmers wracked by severe drought.\\n   In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an\\nestimated $1.1 billion to the drought, but direct federal aid cut\\nthat by 36 percent, to $706 million. In Iowa the aid, calculated by\\nthe federal government at $335 million, went a long way, state\\nagriculture secretary Dale Cochran said.\\n   Without that money, ``it would have meant substantially more\\nlosses to Main Street,\\'\\' Cochran said. ``Drought legislation saved\\nbusinesses from having to close their doors.\\'\\'\\n   To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts\\nin 21 states then chose 14 states whose rainfall data and drought\\npayments were matched county by county in a computer database. From\\nthose results, the AP selected 120 counties for further study.\\n   Farm Entitlement reports, the ASCS summaries of individual\\nfarms\\' participation in the program, were requested for about\\n12,000 farms in those counties under the Freedom of Information Act.\\n   Because much of the ASCS paperwork never leaves the counties,\\nreporters then traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to\\nexamine more detailed drought program files for 346 specific\\nfarmers, also available under the FOIA.\\n   One such farmer was Don Gresham, who raises cotton on 4,000\\nacres near Levelland. Gresham readily offers that he and his son\\noperate their farms under five different names precisely because of\\nfederal payment limitations _ in the case of drought aid, $100,000\\nper farmer.\\n   Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected\\n$248,662 from the drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop\\ninsurance. And he gambled and replanted the lost cotton acres with\\nmilo _ and made a good crop.\\n   According to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly\\n$100,000 more than had he grown his cotton successfully.\\n   ``I\\'ll be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for\\nme,\\'\\' Gresham said. ``You can\\'t farm without the government. You\\nplay their game.\\'\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nOn Friday, The Los Angeles County district attorney\\'s office declined to press charges against several physicians after looking into allegations that they over-prescribed painkillers to actress Elizabeth Taylor.

Lewis believed that after all the preliminary heats that Johnson would not have been able to perform as he did without taking something. Now Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of Johnson\\'s drug test. A Canadian coach said that Johnson might have drunk contaminated beer, given to aid in urinalysis, just before the test. Supposedly, an unidentified man who sat near the beer talked with Lewis. Lewis\\' attorney said the charge was ludicrous. Johnson had earlier taken drugs to induce growth of muscle tissue.\\nIntroduction:\\nCarl Lewis said he knew Ben Johnson was taking performance-enhancing drugs just \\nafter their 100-meter final last fall at the Seoul Olympics. \\n\\n\"He got out of those blocks like a caged lion,\" Lewis said in an interview \\nSunday at the Los Angeles Marathon, where he was representing a sponsor. \"How \\ncan anybody in the world do that after running all those rounds (preliminary \\nheats)? \\n\\n\"I said, \\'Look, I don\\'t know what he is taking or what he is doing, but he is \\ndoing something.\\' \" \\n\\nNow Lewis has been implicated in an alleged sabotage of Johnson\\'s drug test, \\nwhich returned a positive result for the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol. \\n\\nAt a Canadian inquiry into drug use in sport Monday at Toronto, Charlie \\nFrancis, a Canadian sprint coach, testified that Johnson might have drunk \\ncontaminated beer before a urinalysis. Francis based his theory on the fact \\nthat Johnson took the steroid furazabol three weeks before the Games, not the \\ndifficult-to-detect stanozolol. \\n\\nAccording to Francis\\' testimony, Johnson said that an unidentified man who had \\nbeen talking with Lewis sat near the beer that was provided for the athletes to \\nfacilitate them in providing urine samples. \\n\\nFrancis said that two witnesses told him that the stranger had spoken with \\nLewis in another area of the waiting room. Lewis had finished second to \\nJohnson, who set a world record of 9.79 seconds in winning the 100-meter gold \\nmedal, and subsequently also had to be tested. \\n\\n\"Any allocation or innuendo that Carl Lewis tampered with Ben Johnson\\'s drink \\nor sample is ludicrous,\" said David Greifinger, Lewis\\' attorney. \"These sound \\nlike the last acts of desperate men who know they\\'ve committed wrong and see no \\nother way out other than to continue to lie and to fabricate stories. \\n\\n\"Charlie and Ben should own up to the fact that what they did was wrong, and \\nshould promise to never to do it again and move on with their lives. By \\ncontinuing their present course of action they are just embarrassing themselves \\nfurther.\" \\n\\nLewis could not be reached for comment Monday. \\n\\nThough Johnson\\'s gold medal and Seoul world-record time were both revoked, his \\nworld mark of 9.83 seconds stands. He set the record at the 1987 World \\nChampionships at Rome, where Lewis finished second in 9.93 seconds. \\n\\nLewis said Sunday that officials of the International Amateur Athletics \\nFederation should disallow Johnson\\'s world record from Rome because Francis has \\ntestified his sprinter took drugs before the World Championships. \\n\\nIf that were to happen, Lewis would replace Johnson as the world record-holder. \\nIAAF officials, however, said the record will stand because Johnson passed a \\ndrug test after the 1987 race. \\n\\n\"If it has been proven that he took drugs, I would think that (withdrawing the \\nrecord) is the responsible thing for the sport,\" Lewis said Sunday. \\n\\nLewis also contended that Francis\\' testimony painted a false picture as to why \\nJohnson would take performance-enhancing drugs. \\n\\nAccording to testimony, since 1981 Johnson has taken such drugs as furazabol, \\nstanozolol and the human growth hormone, which is taken from the pituitary \\nglands of human cadavers or can be taken in synthetic form. The drugs induce \\nthe growth of muscle tissue, and some athletes claim, help performances. \\n\\n\"He is trying to say that everyone was on it, so they got on it,\" Lewis said. \\n\"That\\'s not true. They wanted to beat people. That\\'s why they got on drugs.\" \\n\\nLewis said track and field is not infested with steroid users as some are \\nbeginning to believe in light of the Canadian inquiry. He said about 90% of the \\nathletes are drug-free. \\n\\n\"Most of your great athletes are clean,\" Lewis said. \"There are athletes who do \\nhave a problem. I can tell who\\'s on it. I\\'ve been around it too long.\" \\n\\nLewis, however, refused to implicate any of his colleagues. \\n\\nBut Lewis defended Evelyn Ashford, a world-class sprinter who was implicated as \\na steroid user in Francis\\' testimony last week. Lewis and Ashford are teammates \\non the Santa Monica Track Club. \\n\\n\"No way in the world does she take drugs,\" Lewis said, pounding a table. \"She \\nis a victim. That\\'s going to happen. I don\\'t think that will hurt her image \\nbecause Evelyn is clean and she always stood for being clean. People who know \\nher know it.\" \\n\\nIn finishing second at the Olympics, Lewis set a U.S. record of 9.92 seconds. \\n\\nEven before Lewis replaced Johnson as the gold-medal winner two days after the \\nrace, the U.S. Olympian said he was happy with his result. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve come to grips with the fact that I\\'m the best I can be and I can\\'t ask \\nfor anything more,\" he said. \"I\\'m doing what is right. I have to feel there is \\nsome merit to that. It didn\\'t ease the pain of not winning and feeling he \\n(Johnson) was on drugs. But it made me feel like I\\'m putting something back \\ninto track and field because I\\'m setting an example.\" \\n\\nLewis called for Johnson to also become a role model. \\n\\n\"I think Ben is 110% irresponsible in not coming out and telling kids to stay \\noff drugs,\" he said. \"He needs to stand up and say, \\'Don\\'t do it. Look what \\nhappened to me whether I knew it or not, make sure you know. Don\\'t take it \\nunless you know what it is.\\' \\n\\n\"But he is perpetuating continued drug use. I think he\\'s just lying to himself. \\nThe biggest thing about drug use is denial. Somebody takes cocaine because they \\nwant to get high. Some people take steroids because they want to run faster. \\nIt\\'s the same thing. You\\'re trying to cheat somehow.\" \\n\\nLewis, who won four gold medals at the 1984 Summer Games and has been one of \\nthe great sprinters and long jumpers in track and field, said he is determined \\nto help the sport\\'s image. \\n\\n\"That\\'s what people don\\'t realize,\" he said. \"I could leave it all alone but \\nthe thing is, I want track to be a better sport than when I came. If anybody \\ngets what they deserve in track and field, it\\'s me. I make the most money, I \\nget the appearances. But I still believe that through it all I want to help \\nevery single person whether they make $50 a meet or near what I make.\" \\n\\nLewis said his deep-rooted conviction comes from his parents, who raised him to \\nstand by his beliefs. Lewis said their philosophy was inspired by the late Dr. \\nMartin Luther King, who once said it is important to make such sacrifices. \\n\\n\"That people cannot sacrifice for something in their life, whether it is a \\nsmall insignificant thing to others or a big thing to the world, what\\'s the use \\nof living?\" Lewis asked. \"I feel if I can\\'t sacrifice myself for the betterment \\nof other people in track and field, well, then I cannot leave a legacy that \\nwill be remembered.\" \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAt the end of a high-speed chase in Santa Clara County a police officer takes his baton and brutally hits the suspect on the back eight times, kicks him in the face, picks him up by the shoulders and slams his face into the pavement.

He\\nis then picked up by his shoulders and his face is slammed into the pavement.\\nThe suspect, unconscious, is taken to Valley Medical Center where he is found\\nto have a dislocated shoulder, a concussion, and numerous cuts, bruises and\\ncontusions.  \\n\\nThis was a real case involving a Santa Clara County police agency. I\\nrepresented the suspect.\\nThe offending officer\\'s police report indicated\\nthat the suspect\\'s injuries were due to a fall from his bike and that he\\nappeared unconscious, although he had also struggled against being\\nhandcuffed.\\nThere is no mention of police brutality. None of the back-up\\nofficers reported any brutality. One sergeant reported that the suspect kept\\ntrying to move around and had to be told to remain lying down. Another officer\\nreported that the only verbal abuse was by the suspect toward officers.\\nThe suspect subsequently complained of brutality. The internal affairs\\ndepartment determined that the complaint was unsubstantiated and the matter\\nwas dropped.\\nBut four citizens called to complain that they had witnessed\\nthe arrest and that the suspect not only was not struggling but also had been\\nbrutally beaten.\\nAccording to the witnesses, the officer taunted the\\nsuspect, knelt on the suspect\\'s stomach, beat him numerous times with his club\\nand kicked him in his face.\\nThe witnesses also said:\\nThe suspect at no\\ntime resisted. The only words from the suspect were pleas for help. In\\nresponse to another officer\\'s inquiry, the original officer picked up the\\nsuspect, let his head fall to the pavement and said, \"It looks like he\\'s\\ndead.\" Both officers smirked and laughed.\\nThe offending officer was later\\narrested and prosecuted by the district attorney.\\nWhat if there had not\\nbeen four citizens who observed the brutal beating of my client?\\nOne of\\nthe problems in monitoring police brutality is that almost all victims of\\npolice abuse have themselves committed some kind of law violation. This makes\\ntheir complaints difficult to sustain.\\nBut there is another problem: a\\npolice discipline system that is cloaked in secrecy.\\nSan Jose Police Chief\\nJoseph MacNamara recently referred to the Los Angeles incident as \"disgusting\\nbrutality\" and pointed out that the disturbing aspect was the failure of\\nleadership and the code of silence. MacNamara diagnosed the problem as an\\norganizational attitude for which the leadership must take responsibility. He\\ncorrectly notes that it is important for police credibility that police chiefs\\nbreak the code of silence and repudiate such acts and attitudes.\\nUnfortunately, MacNamara also believes that San Jose does not need a citizens\\'\\nreview board. I respectfully disagree. That is precisely what we need.\\nCommunities often don\\'t know the extent and the nature of police misconduct.\\nState privacy laws combined with investigation and reporting procedures keep\\nbrutality complaints sealed.\\nThis is bad public policy. Government must\\nremain accountable to its citizens. Those government employees who are given\\nthe right and the power to use force against citizens should be the most\\naccountable. As MacNamara points out, police are public servants. A minimal\\ninvasion of their privacy is a small price to pay for the power to maim and\\nkill.\\nMonitoring police brutality is further complicated by the fact that\\nlocal communities leave it to the police departments to investigate citizen\\ncomplaints. Although the penal code makes the findings of investigations\\nconfidential, investigations themselves can be conducted by the public and can\\nbe open to the public.\\nComplaints of police brutality should be handled in\\nan open process that is neutral and thorough. Having the fox guard the chicken\\nhouse fails to provide that assurance.\\nThe attitude of the public will\\ndetermine the effectiveness of the police discipline system. A system can be\\ntheoretically sound, but it must be respected by the public.\\nI agree with\\nCouncilwoman Blanca Alvarado\\'s suggestion and the San Jose City Council\\'s\\ndecision to create a system where a city official will receive and track\\ncitizen complaints about the police. I would further recommend that local\\ncommunities establish citizen review boards.\\nPolice accountability\\nincludes the right of the public to review records of investigations of\\ncomplaints. Any loss of police confidentiality is a fair and necessary\\ntrade-off for the right to carry and use a club.

Franking privileges and campaign finance laws make defeating an incumbent very difficult, with 96% of incumbents re-elected over the past three elections. Also, one in four incumbents this year will have no major party opposition. This trend is spreading to the Senate. Since presidents are limited to two terms, political power has shifted to the legislature. Congressional careerism has become the norm, and some want a constitutional amendment to limit terms.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nAs Congress goes back into session today, the gulf between\\nlegislators and the American people has never been greater. A\\nrecent Gallup survey found that 70% of House Members oppose\\nthe idea of limiting the number of congressional terms, while\\nthe public backed the idea two to one. Now a detailed New\\nYork Times/CBS poll has found that Members of Congress may be\\nthe only demographic group in the country that doesn\\'t favor\\nlimits on terms. The rest of the country is frustrated with a\\nlegislature where the turnover is about that of the\\nnon-elected British House of Lords.\\n\\nThe idea of limiting terms is overwhelmingly popular with\\nAmericans regardless of party, ideology or income. Women are\\nmore in favor of the idea than men. Martin Plissner,\\npolitical director for CBS News, says he has \"never seen an\\nissue on which there was so little demographic variation.\"\\nThe message is clear. Dissatisfaction with Congress is almost\\nuniversal.\\n\\nThe root of the problems with Congress is that, barring\\nmajor scandal, it is almost impossible to defeat an\\nincumbent. In the past three elections, 96% or more of House\\nincumbents who ran won. This lack of turnover has resulted in\\nlegislative arrogance, a dearth of new ideas and\\nunaccountability. Congress just violated its legal budget\\ndeadline; where are the special prosecutors?\\n\\nFranking privileges, huge staffs, gerrymandering and\\nunfair campaign finance laws have combined to give incumbents\\na grossly unfair advantage. One out of four House districts\\nthis year likely will have an incumbent running with no\\nmajor-party opposition -- up from one out of five in 1988.\\nOne-candidate races are now spreading to the Senate.\\nDemocratic Arkansas Senator David Pryor had spirited\\ncompetition in 1984 when he won with 57%; this year he has no\\nopponent at all.\\n\\nSenators have become just as brazen as their House\\nbrethren in shutting out competition. Take Republican Senator\\nLarry Pressler\\'s latest mailing to South Dakotans. It\\ncontains five pictures of the Senator and mentions his name\\n29 times on four pages. Last year, Mr. Pressler sent out more\\nthan 2.8 million pieces of mail, the equivalent of 10 pieces\\nper household.\\n\\nCritics of term-limits say that -- franked mail or not --\\nit\\'s wrong to blame Congress for the now nearly 100%\\nre-election rates since it is just as easy to vote against an\\nincumbent as for. Michael Kinsley writes in the New Republic\\nthat if incumbents always win, it\\'s because voters can\\'t be\\nbothered.\\n\\nThis presumes that voters can find out who the other\\ncandidate is. It is a political axiom that people won\\'t vote\\nfor someone they know nothing about. That takes money, and\\nskewed campaign finance laws combined with taxpayer-paid junk\\nmail effectively mean that only incumbents have the cash to\\nmake themselves known and to be taken seriously by the media.\\nIncumbents ended the 1988 elections with $63 million left\\nover, while challengers were able to raise and spend a total\\nof only $39 million.\\n\\nSome complain that limiting terms would infringe on\\ndemocracy by not allowing voters to elect whom they please.\\nThe polls indicate voters by two to one think the only way\\nthey can control Congress effectively is by limiting terms.\\nWe also note that these critics are not agitating in support\\nof Ronald Reagan\\'s call for repeal of the two-term limit for\\nPresidents. A big problem of the current system limiting\\nPresidents but not Congress is that this means political\\npower is constantly tipped in favor of the legislative\\nbranch.\\n\\nGetting incumbents to reduce the advantages they have\\nvoted themselves is something like asking banks to leave\\ntheir vaults unlocked. That\\'s why the Washington, D.C.-based\\nAmericans to Limit Congressional Terms is asking states to\\ncall for a constitutional amendment to limit terms. It\\nalready has won in Utah and South Dakota. This fall, the\\ngroup will try to get both incumbents and challengers to\\npledge they will not serve more than 12 years in office.\\n\\nSelf-imposed limits on office-holding were once part of\\nthis country\\'s public-service ethic, with Members returning\\nto private life after a couple of terms. As late as 1860, the\\naverage length of House service was four years. The number of\\nfreshmen in a new House never dipped below 30% until 1901. In\\nthe current House it is 8%.\\n\\nTerm limitation, once the accepted American tradition, has\\nbeen replaced by congressional careerism. The opinion polls\\nfor term limitation show that the voters don\\'t like the\\nchange. They now think the voluntary service limitation of\\nthe past must be made mandatory.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nErnesto Beatriz Martinez was a late participant for the San Diego International Marathon. Martinez had to make his way on a 12-1/2 hour bus ride from his home to Tijuana and then across the border to San Diego. He arrived just in time for the start of the race. Martinez, in an amazing feat of endurance, won the 26-mile plus race in 2:16:12. The women\\'s division winner was Marie Rollins, a former Irish Olympic team member. Martinez and Rollins received $5,000 each for their victory. Martinez commented that his purse would help him to repay his family and friends for the trip.\\nIntroduction:\\nWhile more than a thousand runners were treated to an evening of comedy, music \\nand magic at Saturday night\\'s carbo load dinner on Mission Bay, Ernesto Beatriz \\nMartinez of Mexico City was treated to a bumpy 12 1/2-hour bus ride from his \\nhometown to border town Tijuana. \\n\\nNot until early Sunday morning did Beatriz Martinez, 29, cross the U.S./Mexican \\nborder to register for, then reach the starting line of, the San Diego \\nInternational Marathon on East Mission Bay Drive. \\n\\nHis recovery was simply amazing. Two hours, 16 minutes and 12 seconds later, in \\nonly his second marathon -- his first was this event last year when he finished \\neighth -- Beatriz Martinez crossed the finish line 39 seconds ahead of South \\nAfrican Mark Plaatjes, now of Lake Forest, Ill. \\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t 100% sure I\\'d win,\" he said through an interpreter, \"but I had much \\nconfidence that I\\'d do well. I was well prepared.\" \\n\\nMarie Rollins, a member of the 1988 Irish Olympic team and now of Glendale, \\nkicked her race up a gear after the 16th mile and won the women\\'s race in \\n2:39:05, handily defeating hometown favorite Mindy Ireland (2:42:18) of \\nEscondido. It was the first marathon Rollins has completed this year, after \\ndropping out of the New York City Marathon four weeks ago in mile 18 because of \\nstomach cramps. \\n\\n\"The main thing was to feel the best I could,\" said Rollins, 30. \"I went out \\nreal conservative, I ran my own race and it paid off.\" \\n\\nIndeed it did. Beatriz Martinez and Rollins received $5,000 each for their \\nvictories. \\n\\nAnd for Beatriz Martinez, who ran cross country for San Diego City College in \\n1988, he might as well have won the lottery. This was a man who earlier this \\nweek was running in tattered shoes and had a TV raffled in his honor to raise \\nthe $180 required to cover transportation, the entrance fee and other expenses. \\n\\n\"I want to help my family and friends who raised the money for me,\" said \\nBeatriz Martinez, a school teacher in Mexico City. \"My family, they are very \\npoor.\" \\n\\nPlaatjes and Ireland took home $2,500 each, and Maurilio Castillo (2:18:06) of \\nNaucalpan, Mexico, the men\\'s third place finisher, and Great Britian\\'s Gillian \\nHorovitz (2:43:20), now of New York City, third in the women\\'s race, received \\n$1,500. \\n\\nDoug Kurtis of Detroit was successful in his bid to run his 12th marathon in a \\ncalendar year under 2 hours, 20 minutes. His 2:18:16 finish set a world record. \\nKurtis was originally awarded third place, but miscommunication somewhere along \\nthe 26.2-mile course gave Castillo third in his first marathon and moved Kurtis \\nto fourth. \\n\\nCastillo was entered in the accompanying half marathon, but he and Pedro \\nCasillas missed that races\\' turn at just over the mile mark and mistakenly \\nfollowed the longer route. \\n\\nAccording to Dr. Bill Burke, co-owner of the marathon, Castillo was told \\nseveral times that he was running the marathon course, but he decided to \\ncontinue. \\n\\n\"I traveled too much to get here to go home and say I went the wrong way,\" \\nCastillo said, also using an interpreter. \\n\\nThere was some question that Castillo hadn\\'t finished the entire race as \\nreporters and photographers on the lead vehicle didn\\'t see him for several \\nmiles. But Plaatjes said it was because he and Casillas, who eventually dropped \\nout at mile 18, were so far ahead of the lead pack of Plaatjes, Danny Bustos, \\nDick LeDoux, Kurtis and Leodigard Martin. \\n\\n\"We saw them way ahead of us,\" said Plaatjes. \"I told them (Bustos, LeDoux and \\nMartin) not to worry about me, I\\'m not racing, but they better go catch the \\nother guys. The first time we caught them was at 18 miles.\" \\n\\nSaid Burke: \"My position is that he paid the same fee, he ran the same race and \\nhe finished the race.\" Although the city didn\\'t allow any vehicles on the \\ncourse from miles 18-22, Burke said cameras would verify that he did cover the \\ncomplete distance. \\n\\nBustos of Las Vegas, N.M., led for the first 14 miles, followed closely by \\nPlaatjes, Beatriz Martinez and LeDoux. But Beatriz Martinez took the lead at 23 \\nmiles and Plaatjes couldn\\'t close the gap. \\n\\nRollins and Ireland ran together for 11 miles until Kathy Smith of Irvine took \\nthe lead for miles 12-17. Rollins reeled Smith in gradually and took the lead \\nfor the remainder. \\n\\nMarathon Notes \\n\\nMarie Rollins\\' time is the fourth best for women in San Diego-area marathon \\nhistory and breaks Chantal Best\\'s 1988 race record of 2:42:22.

A second dairy farmer has died of a related human brain disorder, Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) causing some to maintain that BSE can trigger CJD. BSE, CJD and scrapie, the ovine form of the disease, are all caused by an abnormal form of protein, the prion, that converts normal protein into its own abnormal form. BSE can be transmitted by injecting or eating large amounts of infected tissue, but no human is likely to be exposed to BSE in sufficient quantities to develop the disease.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or \\'mad cow\\' disease -\\nwhich has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK - is causing a new wave\\nof public concern. New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and\\nlast month a second dairy farmer died of Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease, a brain\\ndisorder similar to BSE.\\nRichard Lacey, a microbiology professor at Leeds University and the leading\\ncritic of government policy on BSE, said the deaths this year of two farmers\\nwhose herds had suffered from mad cow disease could not be put down to\\nchance.\\nHe believes that BSE can trigger human brain disease.\\n\\'Our worst predictions are coming true,\\' he said. \\'I find it unbelievable\\nthat the government and their hand-picked advisers can go on telling the\\npublic there is no danger.\\'\\nThe advisers, led by the government\\'s chief medical officer Kenneth Calman\\nand chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum, put out a detailed statement to\\njustify their view that last month\\'s death of 65-year-old Duncan Templeman -\\nfollowing that of Peter Warhurst, 61, a year ago - showed \\'no features that\\ngive cause for undue concern\\'.\\nThe official view is that the deaths are an unfortunate coincidence, even\\nthough it is statistically unlikely that two dairy farmers should contract a\\ndisease as rare as CJD. Robert Will of Edinburgh\\'s Western General Hospital,\\nwho has been monitoring CJD in the UK since 1990 on behalf of the health\\ndepartment, calculated that there was only a five per cent probability of\\neven a single case occurring by chance among dairy farmers with BSE-affected\\nherds.\\nOne argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a\\nlong incubation period - typically 10 to 20 years - that clinical symptoms\\nwould not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD.\\n\\'Since the illness of the cows (in Templeman\\'s herd) and the patient\\noccurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had\\npresumably incubated disease in parallel for some years,\\' the health\\ndepartment said.\\n\\'It is most unlikely therefore that there is any direct link between the\\ncases of BSE and the occurrence of disease in the patient.\\'\\nAnother reassuring argument is that both farmers showed clinical features\\ntypical of the \\'sporadic form\\' of CJD - of unknown cause - that usually\\noccurs in late middle age.\\nThe handful of patients known to have developed CJD through infection (from\\ncontaminated human growth hormone) showed a different pattern of symptoms.\\nThe second annual report of Will\\'s National CJD Surveillance Unit in\\nEdinburgh, published last month, shows what looks at first sight like a\\ndisturbing rise in incidence: from 32 UK cases in the year ended April 1991\\nto 37 in 1991/92 and 46 in 1992/3. But the report says that this is not\\nstatistically significant and is probably due to increasing awareness of CJD\\n(some cases were previously attributed to Alzheimer\\'s or other forms of\\ndementia).\\nMeanwhile, cattle are succumbing to BSE at a rate of about one per 100 every\\nyear. The epidemic continues to defy the ministry of agriculture\\'s\\npredictions that it is about to wane; so far this year there have been\\n26,695 reported cases, compared with 25,898 to the same date last year.\\nThe source of infection was protein-rich cattle feed contaminated with\\nscrapie, a related brain disease of sheep. Although sheep-derived feeds were\\nbanned from sale in 1988, farmers apparently continued to use existing\\nstocks for longer than the ministry had expected. The incubation period is\\nalso longer than originally expected.\\nVeterinary experts say that almost all of the 102,000 confirmed BSE cases so\\nfar can be attributed to scrapie-contaminated feed. According to their\\ninvestigations, maternal transmission from cow to calf - which would prolong\\nthe epidemic - is very rare or non-existent.\\nScientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem: BSE,\\nscrapie and CJD are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which\\ndoes not follow the normal rules of microbiology.\\nRecent research shows that the prion is an abnormal form of a protein that\\nis normally present in the brain (though its normal function is not yet\\nknown). Unlike viruses and bacteria, prions contain no genetic material of\\ntheir own.\\nThe prion may arise by a genetic mutation (spontaneous or inherited) in the\\nhost animal. Or - in the case of BSE - it may arrive from another animal.\\nOnce in place in the victim\\'s brain, it catalyses what John Collinge, a\\nprion researcher at St Mary\\'s Hospital Medical School, London, called a slow\\n\\'chemical chain reaction\\', converting the normal protein into its own\\nabnormal form. The prion molecule is folded in a way that makes it extremely\\nstable and therefore difficult to destroy by conventional sterilisation.\\nExperiments show that BSE can be transmitted between species, for example\\nfrom cow to monkey, by injecting or eating large amounts of infected tissue.\\nBut \\'transmission is dose dependent,\\' Collinge says.\\nMost independent experts maintain that no human being - dairy farmer or beef\\neater - is likely to be exposed to BSE in sufficient quantities to develop\\nbrain disease.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nCanadians were shamed, angry, and saddened that sprinter Ben Johnson had been stripped of his Olympic Gold Medal for using performance enhancing drugs.

Morote had arrived in Lima a week ago to coordinate terrorist attacks in Lima. The Shining Path was founded by Abimael Guzman. It is a splinter of the Peruvian Communist Party and is seeking to overthrow Peru\\'s elected government and install a peasant and worker state. Eight years ago the group took up arms after conducting semi-clandestine political work with peasants in the Andean highlands for 10 years. Guzman, not seen for years, still is recognized at the group\\'s leader.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Police captured the top military leader of the\\nShining Path, a Maoist rebel group whose eight-year guerrilla war\\nhas taken more than 10,000 lives in Peru, officials said Monday.\\n   Officials said the capture of Osman Morote, 43, considered the\\nmost radical leader of the movement, was the hardest blow to date\\nfor the rebels since they launched their guerrilla war in the\\nAndean highlands in May 1980.\\n   ``Osman Morote is considered the No. 2 of the party and its\\nmilitary chief,\\'\\' the independent magazine Si said recently. ``For\\nsome Shining Path experts, Morote might even be, in practice, the\\ntrue leader of the organization.\\'\\'\\n   Abimael Guzman, a former professor of philosophy, founded the\\nShining Path movement and is generally recognized as its leader.\\n   The Shining Path is seeking to overthrow Peru\\'s elected\\ngovernment and install a peasant and worker state patterned after\\nthe ideas of Mao Tse-tung.\\n   Deputy Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla said Morote was\\narrested before dawn Sunday at a house in downtown Lima along with\\ntwo women. Police sources said two other men also were arrested.\\n   Mantilla said Morote had fake identification papers but was\\nidentified by his fingerprints.\\n   Counterinsurgency sources said police raided the house after\\nneighbors told them of suspicious behavior by the people living\\nthere. The sources said police discovered revolutionary propaganda,\\ndynamite and a revolver.\\n   Col. Javier Palacios, a top official in the counterinsurgency\\npolice, presented Morote to the press Monday but did let him speak.\\n   Palacios said police had suspected Morote was in the house. He\\nsaid Morote put up no resistance.\\n   The colonel said Morote arrived in Lima a week ago from the\\nnorthern highlands to coordinate terrorists attacks in the capital.\\nPalacios said the attacks were planned this week to mark the second\\nanniversary of prison riots in which security forces killed more\\nthan 250 rebel inmates.\\n   There have been reports in recent months of a growing rivalry\\nbetween Morote and Guzman, and Mantilla said he did not discount\\nthe possibility that Guzman betrayed Morote to get him out of the\\nway.\\n   Morote, known within the rebel band as ``Comrade Remigio,\\'\\' is\\nsecond in importance only to Guzman, who founded the Shining Path\\nas a splinter group of the Peruvian Communist Party.\\n   The Shining Path devoted itself to 10 years of semi-clandestine\\npolitical work with peasants in the impoverished Andean highlands\\nbefore taking up arms.\\n   Guzman is the ideologist of the organization, but Morote is\\nconsidered the military strategist of the guerrillas and the\\nadvocate of attacks against peasant communities in the highlands\\nthat have formed civil defense units on the orders of the military.\\n   Counterinsurgency sources said Morote\\'s capture will create a\\npower vacuum within the central committee of the Shining Path and\\nspark tension until a replacement is found.\\n   Guzman, Morote and other Shining Path leaders went underground\\nin the late 1970s before launching their guerrilla war, which has\\nclaimed more than 10,000 lives.\\n   Guzman has not been seen for years and rumors have circulated\\nthat he may have died. But most counterinsurgency experts believe\\nthat Guzman, described as brilliant by his former professors, is\\nstill alive.\\n   Guzman has become a mythical figure for Peruvians. Various\\nrumors say that he is living abroad, that he moves about Peru\\ndisguised as a priest, that he works as a day laborer in Lima\\'s\\ncrowded street markets.\\n   Since 1980, the movement has expanded from its base in the\\nhighland state of Ayacucho and now launches attacks throughout much\\nof this impoverished nation.\\n   Damage to the economy from sabotage is estimated at $5 billion.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nExxon crews finished pumping the remaining crude from the Exxon Valdez, preparing to refloat the vessel. Exxon planned to pump air into the hold to aid in refloating the vessel. They said that the oil-catching boom put around the ship after an 11 hour delay, could have touched off an explosion of gases from the oil. The family of fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood, said he wanted to surrender but awaits advice from counsel. The state told fishermen it would not allow a herring season this year. Ordinally, a harvest is usually worth about $12M. Sablefish and shrimp fisheries have also been closed.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Exxon crews Tuesday finished pumping the\\nremaining crude oil out of the tanker Exxon Valdez in preparation\\nfor refloating and removing the source of the nation\\'s worst-ever\\noil spill.\\n   The fugitive captain of the Exxon Valdez sent signals he was\\nready to surrender to face criminal charges of operating the vessel\\nwhile drunk.\\n   Meanwhile, Exxon said placing an oil-catching boom around the\\nship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a giant\\nexplosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the reason\\nit took 11 hours to set the first containment line.\\n   ``The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom\\nthe vessel. We would have lost the vessel,\\'\\' said Exxon Shipping\\nCo. President Frank Iarossi.\\n   A boom wasn\\'t placed around the vessel for 11 hours because it\\nwasn\\'t available in Valdez, Exxon officials have said.\\n   Iarossi also said Exxon has changed its policy because of the\\nspill and now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is\\nprohibited, four hours before sailing. Authorities charged the\\ncaptain had been drinking before the Valdez sailed.\\n   Thick oil has floated over more than 1,640 square miles and\\nsoiled 800 miles of beach. Thousands of animals are known dead,\\nincluding 30 sea otters.\\n   Early Tuesday, Exxon said it had finished transferring about 42\\nmillion gallons of crude to three other ships. Another 42 million\\ngallons of oily waste water remained aboard the Valdez, which\\nspilled more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince William\\nSound when it struck a reef March 24.\\n   The company said crews would attempt to pump air into the hold\\nand refloat the vessel off a reef at high tide Wednesday afternoon.\\nIf freed, the still-leaking ship, which has eight holes some 20\\nfeet long in its hull, will be towed to a remote and already fouled\\ncove for repairs.\\n   Exxon then planned to take the ship to a port in the Far East,\\nor to a Portland, Ore., dry dock. Port officials there said they\\nweren\\'t sure if they\\'d allow that, even though the $12 million\\nrepair bill would provide about 200 jobs.\\n   ``We\\'re not willing to trade in the environment for jobs,\\'\\'\\nPortland port spokesman Darrel Buttice said Monday.\\n   Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said Tuesday there are ``a lot of\\nquestions that need to be answered\\'\\' before the Valdez is allowed\\nin.\\n   Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances there will\\nbe no damage to the British Columbia coast if the tanker is towed\\nto Oregon, and the mayor of Valdez said the ship was not welcome\\nback in the port where it took on the load of crude.\\n   In Washington, Environmental Protection Administrator William\\nReilly said the spill could put the brakes on petroleum exploration\\nthere and in other areas. ``We will take apart the environmental\\nplanning for every aspect of oil development in Alaska and in other\\nsensitive areas where the environment potentially could be\\nthreatened,\\'\\' he told a House appropriations subcommittee.\\n   The family of the fired Exxon Valdez captain, Joseph Hazelwood,\\nsaid the skipper wants to surrender but is awaiting advice from his\\nattorney, according to Lt. Thomas Fazio, commander of the New York\\nState Police on Long Island.\\n   But after Long Island law enforcement authorities waited a\\nsecond day for Hazelwood to turn himself in, the Suffolk County\\ndistrict attorney\\'s office announced there would be no surrender\\nthat day.\\n   Hazelwood, 42, is accused operating the ship while under the\\ninfluence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge\\nof oil. Bail was previously set in Valdez at $50,000.\\n   Of about three dozen oil-soaked otters rescued following the\\nspill, about one-third have died, Alaska Department of Fish and\\nGame spokesman Jon Lyman said. ``Dozens of otters are dying before\\nrescuers can get to them,\\'\\' he said. Six otters were flown to Sea\\nWorld in San Diego on Monday for rehabilitation.\\n   Fishermen counting on the sound\\'s $12 million annual herring\\nindustry were told Monday by the state that it will not allow a\\nseason this year. Sablefish and shrimp fisheries in Prince William\\nwaters also have been closed.\\n   An effort at Sawmill Bay, 11 miles west of Valdez, to keep oil\\naway from a hatchery where 2 million salmon are waiting to be\\nreleased to the sea appeared to be failing. Tendrils of oil had\\nfloated past a boom streched across the bay, said officials.\\n   The spill has shifted public opinion in Alaska about the energy\\nindustry, which has been lobbying for new exploration.\\n   U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski, a champion of oil exploration in\\nAlaska, asked that plans for drilling in Bristol Bay, the state\\'s\\nrichest fishing grounds, be set aside until the industry can\\ndemonstrate that it can respond effectively to spills.\\n   ``The Exxon Valdez accident has taught us that simply having a\\nplan is not sufficient,\\'\\' the Alaska Republican said.\\n   At the first Valdez City Council meeting since the spill, two\\ncouncil members and Mayor John Devens expressed concern that anger\\nand frustration over the spill was surfacing as harrassment of\\npipeline company workers and their children.\\n   Meanwhile, a multimillion-dollar class-action lawsuit was filed\\nMonday in federal court in California against Exxon Corp., charging\\nthat the spill has led to gas prices of 10 to 15 cents more a\\ngallon for California drivers.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Kansas City police have suffered a string of complaints about excessive force and racism.

The guerrillas began fighting cautiously in 1980, but became lethal quickly. The governments claims 20,000 have died and damages of $16 billion. Now 50% of the Peruvians live under emergency law. President Belaunde ignored the guerrillas, while President Garcia, after first trying a liberal approach, became tough, then eventually tried simply to coexist. While Fujimori\\'s campaign pitch advocated economic-development initiatives, his actual policies may be quite different. The government claims to have captured a \"safe house\" in Lima on June 4.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nLIMA -- On June 4, I was among a group of journalists who\\nwere told that the war against the Shining Path (\"Sendero\\nLuminoso\") guerrillas had almost been won. Lucky punches\\nsometimes win wars, and maybe this was the case. We had been\\nallowed into a \"safe house\" that, according to Interior\\nMinister Agustin Mantilla, had been used as headquarters by\\nthe leaders of the Marxist guerrilla movement. The police had\\ndiscovered the house in one of Lima\\'s affluent neighborhoods\\njust two days earlier. This was the underground\\norganization\\'s central nervous system, commented\\ninvestigative Police Chief Fernando Reyes Roca, a short man\\nwho is a consummate bureaucratic survivor. Interior Ministry\\nspokesman Fernando Yavera joked that this find was going to\\nput Shining Path watchers (such as myself) out of business.\\n\\nAlas, as it turned out this was not the rebel\\norganization\\'s headquarters, nor its central nervous system,\\nbut more of an archive and memorabilia repository.\\nNevertheless, it was a very important and unexpected police\\ncoup against the Shining Path -- one that probably could have\\nbrought dramatic results if President Alan Garcia had not\\ndecided to make public the operation so soon after the first\\npolice intervention, in order to score a quick propaganda\\ngain. This impulsiveness gave full warning to the guerrillas\\'\\nentire clandestine apparatus, allowing them to limit\\nconsiderably the damage inflicted on them.\\n\\nAs Alberto Fujimori prepares to take over as Peru\\'s next\\npresident on July 28, the question of whether the Shining\\nPath will hound his administration as it has the previous two\\nranks high among his concerns. Among Shining Path watchers\\n(\"Senderlogos\") there is strong disagreement on fundamentals:\\nIs the Shining Path getting stronger or weaker? Is it making\\nprogress or losing ground among the population? And finally,\\nwho is actually winning the war? There are no easy answers.\\n\\nThere is not much of a dispute on the basic data, however.\\nThe Shining Path went to war in 1980, on the same day Peru\\nwas holding general elections after 12 years of a military\\ndictatorship. Its first actions were cautious, modest and\\noften ludicrous in a crazy way (like hanging dogs from\\nlampposts, with scribbled insults over them to Chinese\\nCommunist martyrs). But the actions intensified and soon\\nbecame quite lethal.\\n\\nWhile President Fernando Belaunde\\'s regime did what it\\ncould to maintain democratic legality at first, it was quite\\nunprepared to deal with any insurgency -- especially with one\\nthat had been meticulously planned and organized several\\nyears before the first shot was fired.\\n\\nIn October 1981, emergency laws were imposed for the first\\ntime on part of Peru; they covered only 2% of the population.\\nNow about 50% of all Peruvians live under emergency law. In\\n10 years, the war between the Shining Path and the government\\nhas cost about 20,000 lives. Damages are estimated at $16\\nbillion, or about 85% of Peru\\'s annual gross national\\nproduct.\\n\\nIf the armed forces have been rightly accused of\\nsystematic violations of human rights (Peru ranks as one of\\nthe world\\'s worst human-rights offenders), the military\\nfaults the civilian authorities for failing to provide\\nmuch-needed leadership. Mr. Belaunde (the first to deal with\\nthe problem), who tried to ignore the insurgency out of\\nexistence, is regarded as a well-meaning but inept leader.\\n\\nThere are no kind words for Mr. Garcia, on the other hand.\\nIn the first weeks of his mandate, he made several right\\nmoves -- like emphasizing his role as commander in chief of\\nthe armed forces and reorganizing the corruption-ridden\\npolice. But things began to unravel soon after. At first, he\\ntried a liberal approach, looking for a dialogue with the\\nfanatical Shining Path, and sending scores of young\\nprofessionals to the emergency areas to attack what he said\\nwere the \"root causes\" of the insurgency. But dialogue was\\ndisdainfully rejected: Dozens of these professionals were\\nassassinated, and the armed forces slowed down their actions,\\nwhile the rebels made largely unimpeded progress.\\n\\nThen, Mr. Garcia tried a tougher approach, and\\nhuman-rights violations surged to their current level. And\\nfor the first time, death squads -- linked by some analysts\\nto Mr. Garcia\\'s APRA Party -- began to contribute to the\\nkilling. Midpoint during his term, Mr. Garcia lost all hope\\nof defeating the Shining Path, and decided just to coexist\\nwith it, says Rafael Merino, a respected analyst on security\\nmatters.\\n\\nNot even in that was Mr. Garcia successful, as violence\\nclimbed steadily during the second half of his term. In 1988,\\n1,986 people were killed as a result of insurgent or\\ncounterinsurgent actions; in 1989, 3,198 were killed; and\\n1,730 during the first six months of 1990.\\n\\nHow well is Mr. Fujimori expected to deal with the\\ninsurgency? His campaign pitch advocated an approach closely\\nresembling that of Mr. Garcia\\'s first year. According to\\nFrancisco Loayza, Mr. Fujimori\\'s adviser on internal-security\\nmatters, military actions against the Shining Path should be\\nsubordinated to economic-development initiatives. \"{The\\nmilitary} should mainly provide security for development\\nprojects,\" Mr. Loayza says. He stressed that the main thrust\\nof Mr. Fujimori\\'s \"pacification\" policies would be to address\\nthe \"structural violence {read: social injustice} that makes\\nsubversion possible.\" Mr. Loayza says that President Garcia\\'s\\napproach failed because of corruption and ineptitude. He also\\nfeels that the Shining Path is weakened, and that an\\nimportant Shining Path faction would be willing to engage in\\npeace talks.\\n\\nThis is only wishful thinking, according to Mr. Merino:\\n\"If President Fujimori thinks he\\'ll finish the war through\\nthose `pacification\\' policies, it will be like riding into\\nbattle with no better dress or weapons than a tuxedo.\"\\n\\nActually, Mr. Fujimori might end up implementing internal\\nwar policies that would be quite different from those\\nadvocated during his campaign. At least, that\\'s what seems is\\ngoing to happen with the economy, where the vote-getting\\npopulist message appears in the process of being replaced by\\na far more orthodox approach. Free-market economist Hernando\\nde Soto, who has been advising Mr. Fujimori during the past\\nmonth, thinks that might be the case. \"He learns fast,\" Mr.\\nde Soto told me recently, \"and he has all the right\\ninstincts.\"\\n\\nEven if Mr. Fujimori proves to be a quick learner, he will\\nhave his work cut out for him. Running against all major\\ntrends of contemporary history, the insurgents have followed\\nShining Path founder Abimael Guzman with the commitment that\\nthe faithful reserve for their prophet. This was evident when\\nwalking through their safe house in Lima. It looked, said a\\nPeruvian journalist, like the seed for the future \"Museum of\\nthe Revolution\" -- wood carvings; woven baskets; tapestries;\\npaintings; chiseled stone; all meticulously, lovingly crafted\\nwith the mythified motifs of the internal war. There were\\nalso the hagiographic representations of Mr. Guzman himself,\\nin the various postures that endeavored to combine the heroic\\nwith the intellectual. A whole closed, inbred culture,\\ndeveloped in the underground and unnoticed by most Peruvians\\n-- except when it explodes in their faces.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nBarber Conable was a very respected New York politician prior to being appointed World Bank president. He is now under fire. Criticism centers on his bank\\'s inability to reduce the burgeoning Third World debt. Some worry that the huge Third World debt will stall growth and thence create instability. The bank has followed the conservative fiscal policies of the man who appointed Conable to his office, Secretary of the Treasury James Baker. His policy is the one of lending new money rather than reducing the debt but this often ends up swamping the recipient countries with interest payments.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nWorld Bank President Barber Conable was so well regarded during his 20-year career as a Republican congressman from New York that some journalists nicknamed him \"H.R.\" -- for \"highly respected.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd to many on Capitol Hill, Mr. Conable still is. \\nRep. Tom Foley, a liberal Democrat from Washington State, calls him \"a very strong asset\" to the 151-nation institution \"because of the enormous respect he has on both sides of the aisle.\" \\n\\n\\nBut at the World Bank, Mr. Conable finds himself under fire. \\nAfter a year and a half in office, he has failed to move the bank into a leadership role on the Third World debt problem. \\n\\n\\n\"The World Bank has been reluctant to step out on this issue in confrontation and conflict with the Treasury,\" charges Sen. Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat and Congress\\'s leading voice on the debt problem. \\nRep. John LaFalce, a New York Democrat and another leader on the issue, agrees. \\n\"There surely is a much larger role for the World Bank in the debt problem than it has played so far, but they just can\\'t get out ahead of the administration,\" he says. \\n\\n\\nWhile the debt morass has deepened, Mr. Conable\\'s World Bank has looked inward, shuffling its organization charts around in a disruptive reorganization and then campaigning for a $74.8 billion increase in its capital. \\n\\n\\nAs Congress considers the increase, liberal critics on Capitol Hill are demanding that Mr. Conable show he is ready to use the bank\\'s vast resources to make some direct impact on reducing the huge burden of Third World debt. \\nHouse Democrats, in fact, cut out of the foreign-aid bill passed last month all $70 million the administration had sought for the first year of the U.S. share of the increase in capital. \\nThe deletion was made pending action by a committee looking into the bank\\'s approach to the debt crisis. \\n\\n\\nSo far, Mr. Conable has approached the debt crisis more like a cautious financier than a bold politician. \\nHe has clung to the bank\\'s traditional role of a conventional lender and adviser to developing nations and has deferred on ideas about the debt to the man who picked him for his job -- U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. \\nMr. Conable subscribes to the \"Baker Plan,\" which stresses new lending by commercial banks and the World Bank to debtor countries that adopt growth-oriented, market-based economic reforms. \\nThe bank has tried to help the countries by tiding them over with some new loans. \\n\\n\\nThat policy contrasts sharply with some of the more aggressive debt-reduction plans. \\nSen. Bradley, worried that the debt burden stalls growth and threatens political stability in developing countries, proposes that Third World debtors be required to make certain economic reforms; in return, their lending banks would forgive some of the loans and write them down on their books. \\nEven the World Bank\\'s longtime financial wizard, Eugene Rotberg -- who quit the bank for Merrill Lynch over Mr. Conable\\'s reorganization plan -- proposed last month that the World Bank guarantee new 20-year commercial-bank loans to Third World countries. \\nOther experts advocate a \"debt facility\" to buy and refinance the debts. \\n\\n\\nDefending his approach to the debt problem, Mr. Conable explains: \"We aren\\'t a financial institution but a development institution. \\nWe can\\'t go to our member countries and say, \\'Give us a tremendous capital increase so we can assume the obligations of all these other creditors that a developing country owes.\\' \\nObviously, that would be viewed as our not performing a development function but our simply accepting other people\\'s risks.\" \\n\\n\\nBut critics reject that view. \\nJeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist who has offered one of many debt-reduction plans, says the World Bank\\'s officials \"have the great potential to play a central role in the problem, but they\\'re basically ducking. \\nThere is a lack of intellectual leadership within the bank itself.\" \\n\\n\\nEven some Reagan administration officials privately despair of Mr. Conable\\'s leadership and fear that it may have been a mistake to appoint him. \\n\\n\\nWhile financial experts often urge the bank to do more, the ponderous institution has intervened only about half a dozen times in debt crises, usually just to guarantee a small portion of a commercial-bank loan package. \\nMr. Conable makes it clear that it won\\'t do that often. \\n\\n\\nRecently, commercial-bank lenders to Brazil tried to get the World Bank to insure a portion of a big new loan package they were negotiating. \\nBut the U.S. Treasury was firmly opposed to the idea, saying it was unnecessary in Brazil\\'s case and might foster the impression that such guarantees should be common. \\n\\n\\nSecretary Baker says Mr. Conable is being criticized largely by legislators and academicians who favor grand debt-relief schemes that would \"take the debt and put it on the backs of the taxpayers. \\nI\\'ll tell you who\\'ll pay for it: you and me when we file our 1040s. \\nIt\\'s a bad idea. \\nThey want Barber to subscribe to it, and I think that he sees that it\\'s a bad idea.\" \\n\\n\\nYet even inside the bank, there is increasing worry that the Third World debt -- totaling $1.19 trillion last year -- frustrates the bank\\'s goals. \\nBecause of \"chronic debt problems . . . the development process in these countries has stalled,\" the World Bank said earlier this year. \\n\\n\\nAlso within the bank\\'s own ranks, there is talk that could lead to a more aggressive role on debt once President Reagan leaves office. \\n\"Baker\\'s approach has to be adapted to the circumstances of today,\" says the bank\\'s No. 2 man, Operations Vice President Moeen Qureshi. \\n\"Perhaps we have excessively underplayed our own role.\" \\nHe adds, \"It seems to me it will be desirable, in the present environment, to see what can be done\" to reduce debt, rather than just lend new money. \\n\\n\\nPartly in response to the external and internal pressures, Mr. Conable sent a debt study to his board early in April. \\n\"The likelihood is that the bank will need to play a more extensive and diversified role in two areas: new money packages and facilitating other forms of financial relief, including debt-reduction schemes,\" declares the study, which was drafted by David Bock, a vice president and the bank\\'s debt expert. \\nThe document even says that for a few debtors, \"consensual debt relief,\" including \"outright forgiveness,\" might be the only workable solution, but it stresses that the bank must avoid moves that threaten the \"preservation of the bank\\'s prime standing in financial markets.\" \\n\\n\\nThe bank\\'s own annual world-debt report illustrates its determination to stick to a back-seat role on the issue. \\nPublished early this year, the report noted that the debtor countries\\' position \"has stubbornly failed to improve,\" said \"imagination and resolve are needed,\" and emphasized that \"leadership will itself be crucially important.\" \\nBut conspicuously absent from the report, which discussed debt-relief proposals from Secretary Baker, Sen. Bradley and others, were any ideas from the bank itself. \\n\\n\\nThe World Bank\\'s ethos is decidedly traditional. \\nFounded in 1944, it has evolved into a well-paid bureaucracy of 6,000 working in 17 buildings a few blocks from the White House, ignored by tourists but a mandatory stop for finance ministers and bankers visiting Washington. \\nThe bank earns more than $1 billion annually, sports a top credit rating in securities markets and lent nearly $18 billion last year. \\nThe U.S. is its biggest shareholder and controls the president\\'s job. \\n\\n\\nThe idea of the bank was to finance a wide range of economically basic construction across the developing world: roads in Africa, power projects in Asia, schools in Latin America, irrigation in India. \\nUnder Robert McNamara, the bank began aiding efforts to alleviate rural poverty, control population growth and fight illiteracy. \\nUnder A.W. Clausen, his successor, it increased its loans to finance structural adjustments -- rather than specific development projects -- in Third World economies and also disbursed money more quickly. \\n\\n\\nUnder Mr. Conable, a low-key, thoughtful man with a self-deprecating sense of humor, new policies have been harder to discern. \\nHe has continued to increase the quick-disbursing, non-project loans but hasn\\'t introduced any new type of lending. \\nHe also has set a goal for alleviating poverty in Asia and has won new financing to help the poor countries of Africa. \\n\\n\\nBut his main achievements have been bureaucratic. \\nHe set up staffs to handle environmental and women\\'s issues. \\nOne of these is the \"Safe Motherhood Initiative,\" a project designed to lower the high rate of deaths during childbirth, especially in Africa. \\nFunds will be increased for related health and nutrition programs. \\n\\n\\nMr. Conable spent roughly a year reorganizing the bank so that project experts and country experts would work more closely. \\nThe new organization is more in tune with current Third World problems, but the change paralyzed the bank for months and delayed loan processing. \\n\\n\\nMr. Conable contends that the reorganization \"has helped a great deal in recapturing the support of our member countries,\" which had refused to approve the bank\\'s budget just before he took office. \\n\"We have had a pretty good year,\" he says. \\n\"We had a 100% support of our budget . . . and we are well on the way toward a substantial general capital increase.\" \\nAnd, he adds, \"I have changed a lot of emphasis in our programs.\" \\n\\n\\nTraditionally, conservatives have criticized the bank, charging that its policies promote central planning and thus discourages market forces. \\nBut the debt crisis is causing liberals to question Mr. Conable\\'s leadership from a different direction. \\n\\n\\n\"Who is calling the shots on debt policy in the administration? \\nThe Treasury. \\nAnd who was responsible for appointing Conable? \\nThe Treasury,\" Sen. Bradley contends. \\n\"They appointed somebody that they knew they could control. \\nMaybe Conable genuinely agrees with Baker, in which case he should be lumped in with Baker for criticism. \\nIf he disagrees, maybe we\\'ll see some new ideas at the World Bank.\" \\n\\n\\nMr. Conable insists that even though he backs the Baker debt strategy, he and the Treasury secretary \"have had strategic disagreements.\" \\nBank staffers cite a loan to Chile last year over U.S. opposition. \\n\\n\\nThe bank has accelerated lending to the 17 most heavily indebted countries. \\nBut the new money is being swamped by interest payments, and commercial banks are putting up little new money of their own. \\nIn 1986, the 17 nations paid back lenders $18 billion more than they got in new loans. \\n\\n\\nAlso that year, the World Bank took back in repayments $291 million more than it pumped into the three largest Latin debtors -- Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. \\nLast year, that was reversed; the three countries received a $719 million inflow. \\nHowever, that again was more than offset by commercial-bank outflows. \\nRep. Joseph Kennedy III, a Massachusetts Democrat, charges that \"the World Bank is just laundering funds that go back to the banks.\" \\n\\n\\nLike Secretary Baker, Mr. Conable instinctively dismisses sweeping debt-relief plans as coercive or non-market-oriented. \\nHe rejects any notion that the bank might get involved in directly refinancing or providing security for debt on a broad scale. \\n\"We are not there to try and handle their short-term debt problems, and if you think we are, then I think you misunderstand the nature of this institution,\" he says. \\n\\n\\nBut Mr. Conable\\'s own nature still isn\\'t clear, Rep. LaFalce argues. \\n\"Barber Conable is an outstanding person,\" he says. \\n\"He had a strong identity here in Congress, which he earned. \\nBut he doesn\\'t have his own identity as president of the World Bank. \\nHe was created by Jim Baker and George Bush in this job. \\nHis reputation now rests on how he defines himself.\" \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAfter a Slovenian coalition of center-right parties trounced reform communists in the first free state elections held in Yugoslavia in 45 years, the new government unanimously proclaimed Slovenia\\'s full sovereignty.

The similarity of human and animal forms of spongiform encephalopathy has raised the question whether people catch it from animals. An outbreak of the human form (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or CJD) in a sheep-herding part of Slovakia where the ovine form (scrapie) was present seemed to suggest a connection. Latest research, however, seems to suggest that the disease is caused by an altered protein (prion) in the brain and is probably spread by consumption of tissue infected with expanding prion.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nBETHESDA, Md. -- Eva Mitrova, a visiting researcher at the\\nNational Institutes of Health here, unrolls a map of her\\nnative Czechoslovakia and points to Poltar, a village where\\nthe strange deaths started.\\n\\nOne day in 1975, a 49-year-old journalist there complained\\nto a doctor that he couldn\\'t concentrate. Soon his\\nhandwriting changed. His vision blurred. Gradually he lost\\ncoordination, sometimes jerking uncontrollably. A few months\\nlater, he died. Under a microscope, parts of his brain,\\nriddled with little holes, looked like a sponge.\\n\\nThus began another chapter in one of medicine\\'s most\\nbizarre mysteries, a tale of sick sheep and mad cows,\\ncannibals and Pennsylvanians, ancient life forms and a cat\\nnamed Max. The plot revolves around a family of brain\\ndiseases, probably variations of a single disorder, called\\nspongiform encephalopathy. It is infectious, invariably fatal\\nand as insidious as termites, sometimes eating away brain\\ncells for years without detection before a critical mass is\\nspongified. Then, over a few months, motor control buckles\\nand cognition crumbles. Victims then die quickly, usually\\nwithin a year.\\n\\nNow, after decades of detective work, medical sleuths\\nappear to be closing in on the molecular culprits behind the\\ndisease. Their dogged pursuit won\\'t nail a public-health\\nenemy No. 1 -- the disease is rare -- but it may pay off in a\\nbig way because the findings could shed light on more common\\nkillers, including Alzheimer\\'s disease. The work also\\npromises basic science breakthroughs. Spongiform research\\nalready has raised questions about a cornerstone of biology\\nand spawned a Nobel Prize.\\n\\nThe uncanny nature of the disorder sometimes grips\\nscientists with a kind of obsessive fascination, notes NIH\\nresearcher D. Carleton Gajdusek. He should know, having\\nchased spongiform leads around the globe for 33 years and won\\na Nobel Prize in the process. Recently the fascination has\\ntaken on a more anxious cast as the disease has struck humans\\nand animals with suspicious regularity in several places,\\nunderscoring a longstanding question: Do people get the\\ndisease from animals?\\n\\nThe question has burned with special intensity since\\nscrapie, the form of the disease in sheep, jumped to British\\ncattle a few years ago after they were fed ground-up parts of\\ninfected sheep. About 20,000 British cattle have been\\ndestroyed since 1986 in hopes of eradicating the spongiform\\n\"mad cow\" disease, which makes the animals jittery before\\nthey keel over.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, the first confirmed case of mad cow\\ndisease outside Britain turned up in Switzerland. U.S. meat\\nproducers have reason to be anxious about this because the\\nincidence of scrapie has been rising in American sheep since\\nthe mid-1980s, says Richard Marsh, a University of Wisconsin\\nscrapie expert.\\n\\nScientists agree, however, that the disease in animals\\nprobably poses little danger to people. Scrapie has existed\\nfor centuries and \"the world is bathed\" in its infectious\\nagent, says Dr. Gajdusek. Yet sheep have never been strongly\\nimplicated in cases of the human form of the disease,\\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. At least not until the\\nPoltar journalist and two other people died of CJD at about\\nthe same time in a rural, sheep-herding part of eastern\\nCzechoslovakia.\\n\\nWhen Dr. Mitrova, a researcher at a Bratislava medical\\ninstitute, heard of the unusual cluster of cases, she decided\\nto investigate. From the first, one clue stood out like a\\nbloodstain: \"Almost all of the people are involved in raising\\nand taking care of sheep,\" she says. The local cuisine\\nincludes a soup of sheep meat stewed in sheep milk. The\\narea\\'s equivalent of chicken soup for colds is sheep brain\\nfried in onions. One CJD victim even slept with a pet sheep\\nuntil age 13.\\n\\nNow such coincidences seem like a serial killer\\'s pattern.\\nAgainst all odds, CJD has struck again and again in the same\\nregion, called Slovakia -- 69 times since 1975, mainly\\ngrouped in two areas. The outbreak has become something of an\\nepidemic around the Orava area, where 26 cases have occurred\\nsince 1987, a rate hundreds of times higher than normal for\\nCJD. Residents of the affected areas \"are very afraid,\" says\\nDr. Mitrova. She has found evidence of scrapie in the area\\'s\\nsheep. Now villagers there call CJD \"our sheep disease.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s a leap of folklore, though, and the sheep link may\\nwell turn out to be false, cautions Dr. Mitrova. Indeed, CJD\\nis a nefarious trickster; the first reported case of the\\ndisease, which entered medical texts in the 1920s, really\\nwasn\\'t CJD after all, scientists now believe. And it usually\\nstrikes so rarely and randomly -- killing about one in a\\nmillion people world-wide each year -- that scientists didn\\'t\\neven begin to suspect it was infectious until 1957. That\\nyear, the NIH\\'s Dr. Gajdusek, then a young scientist casting\\nabout for big questions, planned a trip to Papua New Guinea\\nto visit a friend. He never arrived.\\n\\nEn route, he heard that a primitive New Guinea tribe, the\\nFore, were dying in droves from an unknown brain disorder\\nthey called kuru, \"the shivering disease,\" because it started\\nwith tremors. Fascinated, he dropped everything, plunged into\\nthe backwoods with a local doctor and took charge of\\ninvestigating the affair, to the great annoyance of\\nAustralian authorities then overseeing the area.\\n\\n\"Gajdusek . . . has an intelligence quotient up in the\\n180s and the emotional immaturity of a 15-year-old,\" one of\\nhis mentors warned the Australians in a letter, and \"won\\'t\\nlet danger, physical difficulty, or other people\\'s feelings\\ninterfere in the least with what he wants to do.\" In short,\\nhe was perfect for the job.\\n\\nSoon kuru victims\\' brains started issuing from the heart\\nof darkness to distant medical centers, compliments of Dr.\\nGajdusek. He swapped axes and salt for autopsy rights,\\ndissecting one victim with a carving knife by lantern-light\\nin a native hut during a howling storm, according to his\\nletters home. He and the local doctor, Vincent Zigas, tried\\neverything from tranquilizers to hormones on kuru patients.\\nNothing helped. The cause remained elusive.\\n\\nTwo years later, William Hadlow, a U.S. veterinarian, saw\\na picture of one of the kuru brains in a medical journal and\\nwas struck by its spongy appearance. He had seen that look\\nbefore in scrapie, the sheep disease, and put in a call to\\nthe NIH. Another link fell into place when Igor Klatzo, an\\nNIH scientist, noticed kuru brains resembled ones from CJD\\nvictims.\\n\\nBased on the clues, Dr. Gajdusek, back at NIH, led studies\\nin the 1960s showing kuru, CJD and scrapie to be essentially\\nthe same infectious disease, studies that won the 1976 Nobel\\nPrize for medicine. The discoveries confirmed a\\nlong-suspected connection: The kuru outbreak sprang from a\\nFore mourning ritual, in which relatives ate their deceased\\nkin\\'s lightly cooked, and often kuru-infected, brains.\\n\\nBut the infectious agent continued to baffle scientists.\\nIt somehow could hide in the brain for decades without\\ncausing the usual signs of infection, such as fever. Brain\\ntissue of infected animals could transmit the disease when\\ninjected into different animals\\' brains, yet microscopes\\nrevealed no signs of infectious microbes. And why did the\\nagent sporadically appear in people with no known exposure?\\nIt seemed like \"biological spontaneous combustion,\" says NIH\\nresearcher Paul Brown.\\n\\nIn the early 1980s, scientists discovered that CJD, like\\nAlzheimer\\'s disease, often gums up the brain with a kind of\\njunk, or \"amyloid,\" protein. Further studies showed the junk\\nmainly contains a botched form of a naturally occurring brain\\nprotein, sometimes called a prion. Many scientists now\\nbelieve it\\'s the culprit.\\n\\nBut their theory entails a biologically weird premise:\\nthat the altered protein replicates itself without the aid of\\ngenetic material, the basis of all known reproduction. If\\nthey\\'re right, such self-replicating proteins might be\\nrepresentatives of an ancient twilight zone between life and\\nnonlife-evolution\\'s bridge between molecules and microbes.\\nWhen formed in a brain cell, a molecule of such stuff might\\nbe \"like a bad apple in a barrel converting all the other\\napples,\" says the NIH\\'s Dr. Brown. A hot question: Does the\\namyloid in Alzheimer\\'s disease form similarly?\\n\\nAll this, however, doesn\\'t explain what happened after Dr.\\nBrown baked isolates of the disease agent for an hour at 680\\ndegrees Fahrenheit, a temperature that melts proteins. He\\ninjected the ashy residue into animals\\' brains, expecting\\nnothing to happen. But a few of them got spongiform disease.\\nHe also buried isolates in his garden for three years and\\nfound they remained infectious. The results may be \"very\\ndisquieting,\" he says, to British farmers, who have been\\nburning and burying mad cow corpses.\\n\\nStill, Dr. Brown and other scientists aren\\'t much worried\\nabout mad cows because their animal studies show spongiform\\ndisease is very hard to transmit orally. Eating huge doses of\\nthe agent is required. Perhaps the mad cows got such doses\\n\"every time they went to the feedbag,\" says Dr. Brown. Kuru\\nvictims apparently consumed similar mega-doses. And so may\\nhave Max.\\n\\nHe was a Siamese cat in Bristol, England, that died last\\nspring. Examining his brain, a veterinarian found a telltale\\nsponginess, sparking another round of panic in the U.K. about\\nspongiform disease. Now more than 10 British cats have died\\nof it, suggesting brains from infected sheep or cows got into\\ncat food.\\n\\nMeanwhile, yet another spongiform outbreak has occurred,\\nthis time among northeastern Pennsylvanians. The cluster of\\nmore than a dozen CJD cases \"isn\\'t an epidemic\" and appears\\nto have topped out in 1989, says Brian Little, an Allentown\\nneuropathologist leading a study of it. But it is worrisome\\nbecause, like the Slovakian outbreak, it suggests a common\\nunderlying cause that could strike again.\\n\\nDuring the past few months, the NIH team, working with Dr.\\nMitrova, has found a thread that for the first time may link\\nmany such CJD cases. The discovery began when the scientists\\nferreted out a genetic defect in two U.S. brothers who had\\ndied of CJD. In itself, that was nothing new. Scientists have\\nlong known that CJD runs in some families and therefore\\nsuspected a genetic problem.\\n\\nBut Dr. Brown\\'s excitement grew when three other,\\nunrelated CJD victims were found to carry the same genetic\\ndefect. \"On a flyer,\" he says, \"I called relatives of the\\nvictims and struck gold.\" They were all of Eastern European\\ndescent, suggesting people of similar ancestry might carry\\nthe gene. Drs. Brown and Gajdusek knew just where to look for\\nsuch people. They grabbed a plane for Czechoslovakia.\\n\\nSince then, the team has confirmed that many of the\\nSlovakian CJD victims, and a cluster of Libyan-born Jews\\nwhose tissues were preserved, carried the defect. The\\nfindings suggest one of two things: Either the defect alone\\nproduces the deadly agent or it predisposes its carriers to\\nget CJD when they are exposed to the agent. The findings have\\nopened the door for early diagnosis and possible prevention\\nof CJD.\\n\\nBut they also have introduced a new riddle, says Dr.\\nGajdusek: Why has the genetic defect, which has apparently\\nexisted for decades in some Eastern Europeans, turned deadly\\nonly in the past 15 years or so? \"Essentially, we\\'re stuck\\nwith another paradox,\" he adds. \"But there\\'s nothing else\\nworth working on in science.\"\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nA United Airlines DC-10 with 293 aboard crashed just short of Sioux City, Iowa\\'s airport on July 20, 1989, after the pilot tried for thirty minutes to bring the huge aircraft under control. The plane crashed into a cornfield and broke apart, then exploded and burned. 166 passengers walked away; 127 were killed. The cause of the crash was complete hydraulic failure, unusual because the DC-10 has three independent hydraulic systems, each capable of controlling the plane. It is believed that an engine exploded, causing metal shards to cut some common ducts in the tail section, leading to the failure.\\nIntroduction:\\nA crippled United Airlines DC-10 crashed a half-mile short of a runway while \\ntrying to make an emergency landing Wednesday afternoon, bursting into a \\ncartwheeling fireball that broke into what one eyewitness described as \"15,000 \\npieces\" and killing at least 123 of the 293 passengers and crew members on \\nboard. \\n\\nRemarkably, as many as 166 persons survived the violent crash, according to \\nRichard Vohs, a spokesman for Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad. The fate of four \\nothers was not immediately known. \\n\\n\\nTail Engine Explodes \\n\\nThe plane\\'s tail engine exploded before the crash but it was not immediately \\nclear how the explosion contributed to what a Federal Aviation Administration \\nspokesman called \"complete hydraulic failure,\" an occurrence regarded as \\nextremely rare in the wide-bodied DC-10, which has three independent hydraulic \\nsystems that operate all the plane\\'s control surfaces on its wings and tail, \\nand landing gear and brakes. \\n\\nAs rescuers worked underneath floodlights to remove bodies from the crash site, \\noriginal estimates of the death toll -- one as high as 190, which would have \\nmade the crash the second worst in U.S. history -- were reduced. \\n\\n\"We don\\'t have a firm count\" of the dead, Vohs acknowledged at a press \\nconference seven hours after the crash. \"But right now, the number (of \\nsurvivors) confirmed is 166.\" \\n\\nThe survivors of Wednesday\\'s United Flight 232 from Denver to Philadelphia via \\nChicago included several dozen passengers who managed to walk out of a dark, \\nsmoke-filled, upside-down section of the jet after it broke off and came to \\nrest in a tall cornfield off the runway. \\n\\n\"I walked out (through the back of the plane) and found myself in the \\ncornfield,\" passenger David Landsberger told Cable News Network. \"We were all \\nwalking around in shock. I just walked through it like it was a dream. I was a \\nlittle dazed.\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s the goddamndest thing I ever saw in my life,\" said Charles Mertz of \\nCastle Rock, Colo., another of those who walked away. \\n\\nSuitcases, paper, mail, clothes, chunks of burning metal and bodies were strewn \\nover the inactive runway at Sioux Gateway Airport, where the plane crashed \\nafter desperately circling for a half-hour. \\n\\nOne hundred ambulances, fire trucks and helicopters from as far away as South \\nDakota plucked out the victims. The search for bodies was difficult because \\nsome of them were scattered in the cornfield. Many of the survivors were listed \\nin critical condition with burns or broken bones. \\n\\nUnited Airlines declined to comment on the number of survivors or to release \\nthe names of the 282 passengers and 11 crew members. \\n\\nEyewitnesses said pieces of the 15-year-old airplane -- one of the oldest \\nairliners in United\\'s fleet -- were falling off as far as 75 miles from the \\nsite of the crash. \\n\\nA team of National Transportation Safety Board investigators left Washington \\nWednesday night for Sioux City. \\n\\nThe hydraulic system that disintegrated Wednesday works the same way a power \\nsteering system operates in a car. By forcing liquid through a tube, the system \\nprovides enough power for a pilot to move an airliner\\'s huge tail rudder and \\nelevators, and wing panels known as flaps and ailerons -- all needed to steer \\nan aircraft. \\n\\nSome aviation experts, speculating on why Flight 232 crashed after completing \\nless than half of its scheduled 930-mile trip to Chicago, suggested that the \\nexplosion of the tail engine sent shards of metal through the tail section, \\nsomehow destroying common lines that serve the three hydraulic systems. \\n\\nThere were reports from passengers and observers that the plane\\'s right-wing \\nengine also failed before the crash. \\n\\nIn what survivors described as a heroic effort that nearly succeeded, the \\nplane\\'s Seattle-based captain, A. C. Haynes -- a 33-year veteran of the airline \\nwho along with the other 10 crew members survived the crash -- struggled for a \\nhalf-hour to maintain control of the wobbling plane. Radio transmission \\nindicated the plane\\'s maneuverability was limited to right-hand turns. \\n\\nAt one point, Haynes attempted a landing on Highway 20 near Cushing, Iowa, but \\nchose not to touch down there in favor of trying to make Sioux City, a farming \\nand livestock center of 82,000 in the northwest corner of Iowa along the \\nMissouri River. \\n\\n\\nPreparing for Crash Landing \\n\\n\"Then they said we were preparing for a crash landing. They said it would be \\nabout 30 seconds, but it was about five minutes,\" another passenger said. \\n\\nHaynes brought the plane into the airport\\'s 9,000-foot-long southwest runway, \\nsurrounded by corn, soybeans and pasture with some trees seven miles outside \\ndowntown Sioux City. \\n\\nAt about 4 p.m. CDT, the plane made its final approach. \\n\\nOnlookers watched hopefully. \\n\\n\"We thought it was going to make it,\" said Glen Olson, city editor of the Sioux \\nCity Journal. \\n\\nIt didn\\'t. \\n\\nShortly before touchdown the plane\\'s right wing began to dip and the nose began \\nto fall. \\n\\nThe wing hit the ground a half-mile before the runway. The impact caused the \\naircraft to turn over several times as it slid down the runway, \"breaking up \\nvery badly,\" catching on fire and then exploding, according to Bob Raynesford, \\nan FAA spokesman. \\n\\n\"I think it turned over a couple of times. I think it landed upside down,\" said \\npassenger Melanie Cincala of Toledo, Ohio, who said the plane burst into flames \\nafter she got off. \\n\\nA large piece of the fuselage barreled onto the runway. Huge clouds of smoke \\nand flames billowed upward as firemen sprayed foam over the wreckage. Rescue \\nhelicopters hovered overhead. \\n\\n\"We were sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with smoke,\" said \\nCliff Marshall of Columbus, Ohio, who was returning home from Denver. \\n\\n\\n\\'Push Little Girl Out\\' \\n\\n\"Then God opened a hole in the basement (the bottom of the plane) and I pushed \\na little girl out. I grabbed another, kept pulling them out until they didn\\'t \\ncome no more.\" \\n\\nMarshall said he thought he helped a half-dozen out and then he ran. \\n\\nDr. Romaine Bendixen, clinic commander of Iowa National Guard\\'s 185th tactical \\nfighter group, said he was the first doctor on the scene, about three minutes \\nafter the crash. He had just landed in another plane. \\n\\nHe said the living were scattered among the dead. \\n\\n\"In one group of six seats, a woman sitting in the middle was barely injured, \\nher husband beside her was dead and two behind her were dead,\" Bendixen said. \\n\\nHe said rescuers pulled out three of the flight crew alive. \\n\\nHewitt Graham, manager of Graham Flying Service, a charter service and \\ncorporate aircraft maintenance firm that operates out of the building closest \\nto the crash site, said he was in his office, answering phones, when five crash \\nvictims -- a man, his wife and young son and two other men -- walked in. \\n\\n\"It was amazing. They were in remarkably good shape. From looking at one or two \\nof them you wouldn\\'t know they were in the accident,\" Graham said. Their \\nclothes were clean, not mussed, their hair was in place and they had no \\nscratches he could see, he said. \\n\\n\\nSurvival Rate Remarkable \\n\\nC. O. Miller, former chief investigator for the National Transportation Safety \\nBoard, said the crash\\'s survival rate was remarkable and was probably the \\nresult of the pilot\\'s ability to maneuver the plane close to the ground before \\nlosing complete control. \\n\\n\"If an airplane cartwheels, it is very fortuitous that anybody got out,\" said \\nMiller, now a private aviation safety consultant in Sidona, Ariz. \\n\\nHe said the huge mass of the DC-10 must have helped the pilot slow the plane as \\nit approached the ground and helped keep portions of it intact. He said a \\nsmaller plane, such as a DC-9, would have been far more likely to break up more \\nseverely. \\n\\nSt. Luke\\'s Regional Medical Center said 80 to 90 crash victims had been \\nadmitted and of those 70 were expected to leave the hospital Wednesday night. A \\nspokesman said they sustained light injuries. About 50 survivors were housed \\novernight at Briarcliff College. \\n\\nLavonne Quirin of Alta, in Buena Vista County, 75 miles from the airport, said \\nshe and her husband found a cone-shaped section of the plane in a cornfield at \\ntheir seed corn business. \\n\\n\\n\\'Size of a Car\\' \\n\\n\"It\\'s about the size of a car,\" she said. She said no one at the farm saw or \\nheard the object fall. \\n\\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., which builds the DC-10, said the plane was delivered \\nto United in 1974. \\n\\nUnited, the nation\\'s second largest airline, has one of the oldest fleets in \\nthe industry. The average age of its aircraft is 13.5 years. The average for \\nthe entire industry is 11.7 years. \\n\\nNo unusual weather was reported. Wind speeds were clocked up to 30 m.p.h. \\n\\nA DC-10 was involved in the nation\\'s worst air crash 10 years ago. \\n\\nOn May 25, 1979, American Airlines Flight 191 lost an engine on takeoff, banked \\nsideways out of control, slammed into a field and exploded. All 258 passengers \\nand 13 crew members died, as well as two people on the ground. \\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board cited \"maintenance-induced damage\" -- \\na 10-inch crack in the engine mount -- that caused the left engine to tear \\nloose. The NTSB also criticized McDonnell Douglas\\' design as vulnerable to \\nmaintenance damage. \\n\\nMcDonnell Douglas suspended production of the DC-10 airliner in 1983. DC-10 \\norders collapsed in 1979 because of the recession and the May, 1979, crash. In \\nall, 369 DC-10s were produced. \\n\\nWednesday\\'s tragedy was the worst in a recent series of accidents and mishaps \\ninvolving United. \\n\\nNine persons were hurled to their deaths last Feb. 24 when a cargo door popped \\nopen in flight, tearing a gaping hole in a United Boeing 747 jetliner. The \\ncause of that accident, which took place over the Pacific near Hawaii, is under \\ninvestigation. \\n\\n\\nTurns Up Deficiencies \\n\\nThe accident probe has turned up deficiencies in United\\'s procedures regarding \\nthe cargo doors. The airline told NTSB investigators that it had \"somehow \\noverlooked\" an FAA recommendation to inspect the cargo door latch locks each \\ntime the door is closed manually, rather than electrically. \\n\\nOn July 10, a United Boeing 747 was forced to make an emergency landing at \\nMiami International Airport after the plane was damaged in heavy turbulence \\nover the Florida-Georgia border. None of the airliner\\'s 108 passengers were \\ninjured. On Tuesday, a United DC-10 with 249 people aboard slid 300 yards on \\nthe runway after landing at rain-soaked O\\'Hare International Airport in Chicago \\nbut there were no injuries. \\n\\nLast Dec. 23, a United DC-10 bound for Chicago with 287 passengers had engine \\nproblems after takeoff and dumped 52,000 gallons of fuel over the Pacific \\nbefore returning safely to Los Angeles. \\n\\nThe second-worst crash in U.S. history was an Aug. 16, 1987, crash that killed \\n156 people when a Northwest Airlines jet crashed on takeoff at Detroit \\nMetropolitan Airport.

The disease kills nearly three million a year, most between the ages of 15 and 59. It is anticipated that the number of deaths will rise sharply, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. The increases already seen and those anticipated are attributed in large measure to the connection between AIDS and tuberculosis. At one time experts thought that tuberculosis was on a path to extinction, and its now epidemic proportion is disheartening.\\nIntroduction:\\nTuberculosis has become the world\\'s deadliest infectious disease, and the toll \\ncould soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, \\nthe World Health Organization said Monday. \\n\\nThe U.N. agency, in its first comprehensive look at global tuberculosis in a \\ndecade, said the disease kills nearly 3 million people a year, most of them \\nbetween the ages of 15 and 59, \"the segment of the population that is \\neconomically most productive.\" \\n\\nWHO attributed the sharp rise in part to the growing AIDS epidemic. It \\nestimated that about 3 million people worldwide are dually infected with the \\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, and tuberculosis. \\n\\n\"It is becoming a parallel epidemic, and it is this trend that has public \\nhealth officials worried,\" Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, director general of WHO, said \\nin a statement. \\n\\nThe agency estimated that between 15 million and 20 million adults will be \\ninfected with HIV by the year 2000, and it predicted that the number of cases \\nand deaths from tuberculosis will rise sharply as a result, especially in \\nsub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. \\n\\n\"These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people \\nhad thought that tuberculosis had gone away,\" said Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor \\nof microbiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and a \\nconsultant to the United Nations. \\n\\nTuberculosis is a highly communicable disease of the lungs and other organs \\ncaused by a bacterium transmitted through the air when infected people cough or \\nsneeze. \\n\\nThere are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the \\nU.N. agency. About half of these are infectious. Also, an estimated 1.7 billion \\nindividuals worldwide carry the organism but are not infectious to others. In \\nthese individuals, the organism can remain dormant without causing active \\ndisease for many years unless the immune system is somehow impaired. AIDS, or \\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body\\'s immune system. \\n\\nAn individual does not have to have a damaged immune system to contract an \\nactive case of tuberculosis. But when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as \\nit can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect \\nnumerous others. This is what is happening in developing nations, where the \\nAIDS epidemic is raging. \\n\\n\"In many places, more than half the beds in medical wards are patients with \\ntuberculosis,\" Bloom said. \"Many of these people do, in fact, die of AIDS. But \\nif they\\'re not treated for tuberculosis, those people will be spreading the \\ndisease (tuberculosis) in their communities. You don\\'t have to have a depressed \\nimmune system to get tuberculosis.\" \\n\\nIn the United States, public health officials began to recognize about five \\nyears ago that tuberculosis -- after steadily declining since the 1950s -- was \\nmaking a surprising comeback as a result of the AIDS epidemic. At that time, \\nthey noticed a startling and unexpected drop in the rate of decline of \\ntuberculosis cases. \\n\\nThis year, Bloom said, the number of cases of active tuberculosis in the United \\nStates is up nearly 5% over last year, with 23,495 new cases. \\n\\nThe overall incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is 9.5 cases per \\n100,000 population, he said. In New York City, which has the highest number of \\nAIDS cases in the nation, the incidence is 36 per 100,000, Bloom said. \\n\\nEffective drugs to combat tuberculosis cost about $30 to $50 per person, given \\nover six months. \\n\\nHowever, the drugs are not always available in developing countries, and \\ncompliance is a major problem. The drugs must be taken for the entire six \\nmonths to eliminate the infection. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nOver the past two years the Ventura district attorney\\'s office in four separate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that they were victims of police brutality while being arrested by Oxnard officers. In a fifth case an Oxnard man who says he and others at a private party were beaten by Oxnard police, was prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of resisting arrest rather than assaulting an officer as charged by the arresting officer. The men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality lawsuits. In every case it is alleged that officers beat or severely manhandled the victim without provocation.\\nIntroduction:\\nOver the past two years, the Ventura County district attorney\\'s office in four \\nseparate incidents has declined to prosecute suspects who contended that they \\nwere victims of police brutality while being arrested for various offenses by \\nOxnard officers, records show. \\n\\nIn a fifth and more recent incident, the district attorney\\'s office declined to \\nfile a charge of assaulting an officer against an Oxnard man who says he and \\nseveral other guests at a June 15 private party were beaten by Oxnard police. \\nInstead, Anthony Flores, 22, was charged with five misdemeanor counts of \\nresisting arrest. \\n\\nThe men involved in three of the five incidents have filed police brutality \\nlawsuits against the city, the department or the police officers involved. The \\nsuits, which seek unspecified damages and medical and legal expenses, are \\npending. \\n\\nTwo of the incidents have led to an investigation by the Police Department\\'s \\ninternal affairs division. \\n\\nDeputy Dist. Atty. Edward Brodie, misdemeanor supervisor for the office, said \\nthe decisions not to prosecute the suspects do not necessarily mean that Oxnard \\npolice were not justified in making the arrests. In each of the four cases, \\nBrodie said, his office did not prosecute because it found that police did not \\nprovide enough evidence to prove the charges \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \\n\\nBut Jean Farley, a supervisor for the Ventura County public defender\\'s office, \\nsaid it is extremely rare for the district attorney\\'s office not to prosecute a \\nsuspect who is accused by police. \\n\\nThe district attorney\\'s office may have declined to prosecute the suspects \\nbecause police brutality has been alleged, she said. Prosecution is usually \\nturned down when the arresting officer is suspected of using excessive force, \\nshe said. \\n\\nAssistant Police Chief William Kady declined to discuss the brutality \\nallegations against the Oxnard officers because of pending litigation. He said, \\nhowever, that the decisions by the district attorney\\'s office not to prosecute \\nthe suspects do not reflect poorly on the department. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t think our reputation is any worse than any other department\\'s,\" he \\nsaid. \"There is always going to be a disagreement over how much force is used.\" \\n\\nThe latest incident involving an accusation of police brutality stemmed from \\nthe June 15 clash between 18 officers and about 12 party guests at a house in \\nthe 1300 block of South E Street. \\n\\nIt began when four officers answered complaints about a loud party. A police \\nreport said Flores started the fight by shoving a policeman. Flores and his \\nbrothers, Alex, 19, and Luis Jr., 24 -- all of whom suffered gashes and scrapes \\non their heads and bodies -- said the officers beat them without provocation. \\n\\nPolice had arrested Flores on suspicion of assaulting an officer and of \\nresisting arrest but the district attorney\\'s office decided two weeks later to \\nprosecute Flores on the five misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest. \\n\\n\"Based upon my review of all the reports, the charges were the most appropriate \\ncharges to file,\" said Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald Gran, who declined to \\nelaborate. \\n\\nPolice Chief Robert Owens has ordered an investigation into the incident. \\n\\nIn an incident April 7, Sergio E. Gonzalez, 19, accused Oxnard officers of \\nordering a police dog to attack him before he was arrested. \\n\\nIn a suit filed June 29, Gonzalez said he was standing on Sunkist Circle when \\nthe dog attacked him, biting him on the arm and left shoulder. Gonzalez was \\ntaken to St. John\\'s Regional Medical Center, where he underwent surgery and \\nspent two weeks recovering from his injuries. \\n\\nEdward M. Fox, an attorney representing Gonzalez, said his client, a gardener, \\nmight suffer some permanent injury to his right arm. \\n\\nAccording to a police report filed by Officer Michael Cole, police were sent to \\na parking lot outside the Oxnard Moose Lodge to investigate a report of an \\naltercation between several men after a wedding reception. Cole\\'s report said \\nGonzalez was found hiding in the parking lot and \"was bit by a police service \\ndog during the arrest.\" \\n\\nThe report, however, does not say why the dog attacked Gonzalez or whether \\nGonzalez resisted arrest. Police arrested Gonzalez on suspicion of disturbing \\nthe peace, Brodie said. But the district attorney\\'s office declined to file any \\ncharges because the police report failed to show that Gonzalez was involved in \\nthe altercation, Brodie said. \\n\\nFox said Gonzalez did not attend the wedding but was visiting a friend nearby \\nand went to the parking lot to find out what was causing the commotion. \\n\\nIn a third incident, Louis M. Cornett, a retired teacher and licensed gun \\ndealer, said he was beaten on Oct. 20 while in custody at Oxnard police \\nheadquarters. Cornett said the altercation began as he was returning home after \\nscouting out a site for quail hunting near Santa Maria. \\n\\nOfficer Robert Camarillo said in a police report that Cornett was arrested in \\nthe 3600 block of Taffrail Road on suspicion of brandishing a weapon, resisting \\narrest and possessing a loaded firearm. \\n\\nCamarillo said in the report that he stopped Cornett while investigating a \\ncomplaint of a man waving a gun from a car and threatening youngsters packed \\ninto another vehicle. Camarillo said Cornett fit the description of the man who \\nallegedly brandished the weapon. \\n\\nWhen he searched Cornett\\'s car, Camarillo said, he found a semiautomatic \\nhandgun, several rounds of ammunition and a 12-gauge shotgun. \\n\\nCamarillo admitted that he later shoved Cornett against a wall at police \\nheadquarters because the suspect had struggled and had clenched his fists in a \\nthreatening manner. \\n\\nBut a lawsuit against Camarillo filed May 8, 1989, alleges that while in \\ncustody at the police station, Camarillo shoved and punched Cornett in the \\nmouth. \"He slammed me in the mouth once, twice and a third time,\" Cornett said \\nin an interview. \\n\\nCornett, maintaining that he never struggled with the officer, said he suffered \\na broken tooth and a cut lip during the beating. \\n\\nThe district attorney\\'s office declined to file charges against Cornett \\nbecause, Brodie said, there was insufficient evidence to prove that Cornett \\nbrandished a gun. \\n\\nIn a fourth incident, Alejandro Guzman-Flores, 21, accused three Oxnard \\nofficers of beating him on his face, causing severe damage to his eyesight. \\n\\nGuzman-Flores said he was working in a motorcycle repair shop on Jan. 27, 1989, \\nwhen his boss asked him to investigate a noise in the alley behind the shop in \\nthe 1500 block of South Pine Street. \\n\\nIn a suit filed against the city Nov. 14, 1989, the Police Department and \\nofficers Jana Younger, Fred Sedillos and James Struck, Guzman-Flores contends \\nthat he was grabbed from behind by Younger while in the alley. The officer \\npoked him with a baton and questioned him about a car parked nearby, \\nGuzman-Flores said in the suit. \\n\\nThe Police Department declined to release Flores\\' arrest report because, police \\nofficials said, it contains his criminal history. But Flores\\' lawyer, Sherrie \\nL. McCracken, said the report states that officers were at the shop responding \\nto a complaint of a man with a gun. \\n\\nMcCracken said the officers continued to question Flores in English, but Flores \\n-- a recent immigrant from Mexico who speaks only Spanish -- could not respond. \\nFlores was handcuffed and shoved to the ground, causing Sedillos to trip and \\nfall on him, according to the suit. \\n\\nSedillos got up and punched and kicked Flores several times while Younger held \\nFlores in a \"choke-hold,\" the suit alleges. \\n\\nFlores was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and obstructing an \\nofficer. The district attorney\\'s office decided to prosecute Flores but later \\ndismissed all charges during Flores\\' trial because police failed to turn over a \\nrecording of a dispatcher\\'s call requesting that officers investigate the \\nincident at the motorcycle shop, McCracken said. \\n\\nMcCracken said Flores never struggled with the officers until after he was \\nplaced in the choke-hold. McCracken said Flores was beaten so severely that he \\nsuffered a detached retina and might lose partial sight in one eye. \\n\\n\"They essentially beat the hell out of him for nothing,\" she said. \\n\\nIn another incident, Luis C. Luna, 50, alleges in a complaint filed with the \\ncity on June 27, 1989, that he was beaten by three officers near a restaurant \\nin Port Hueneme. \\n\\nLuna said in an interview that he, his wife and several friends were leaving \\nthe restaurant on July 16, 1988, when an Oxnard police car pulled up in front \\nof the group. Luna, a public works inspector for the city of Port Hueneme, said \\nhe walked up to the police car and asked Officer Peter Ruggiero \"in a kidding \\nmanner\" what he was doing in Port Hueneme. \\n\\n\"The officer jumped out and started pushing me back against the pillar in front \\nof the building, using his baton on my throat,\" Luna said in the complaint. \\n\\nWhen he asked the officer why he was being shoved, Ruggiero told him that he \\nwas under arrest, according to the complaint. Officers Steven Vendt and \\nHumberto Jimenez were called to assist Ruggiero, the complaint said. \\n\\n\"They used forcible brutality by hitting me with the baton on my elbow, knees \\nand back, forcing me to drop down on the sidewalk with my face slammed against \\nthe pavement,\" Luna said in the complaint. \\n\\nLuna was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct under the influence of \\ndrugs. The district attorney\\'s office decided to prosecute Luna, but in \\nSeptember, 1988 -- before his trial began -- all charges against him were \\nwithdrawn for lack of evidence, Brodie said. \\n\\nOwens ordered the department\\'s internal affairs division to investigate Luna\\'s \\ncomplaint. But Luna said the Police Department later sent him a letter saying \\nthe investigation revealed no wrongdoing on the officers\\' parts. \\n\\nLuna had asked the city for $50,000 for medical expenses and to compensate for \\n\"humiliation suffered in public.\" He failed, however, to submit the claim for \\ndamages during the statutory six-month period after the incident and was barred \\nby law from filing a lawsuit. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nHurricane Joan churned across the open Caribbean following an unusual, coast-hugging path.

There was a report that the storm left 50 people dead or\\nmissing in a town in Colombia the day before.\\n   ``Joan is one of a kind,\\'\\' said Jim Gross, a meteorologist at\\nthe National Hurricane Center. ``You just don\\'t see many hurricanes\\nthat take this course and hug the coast.\\'\\'\\n   In Colombia, an official of the state of Bolivar in the northern\\npart of the country said the storm triggered flooding in the town\\nof Carmen de Bolivar, about 360 miles north of the capital of\\nBogota.\\n   Water roared down three gullies in the town as the storm passed\\nMonday, Victor Leon Mendoza, a state government administrator, told\\nthe Colombian radio chain RCN.\\n   ``Preliminary reports from the mayor\\'s office indicate that\\nabout 50 persons are dead or missing\\'\\' in the town, he said.\\n   At noon EDT today, Joan\\'s center was near latitude 11.1 north\\nand longitude 76.3 west, about 70 miles west of the Colombian coast\\nand about 380 miles east of the island of San Andres off the coast\\nof Nicaragua.

News of the hormone, Amylin, was reported by Dr. Garth Cooper of New Zealand to the International Diabetes Federation. Researchers believe that amylin, found in high levels in the diabetic pancreas, appears to be responsible for the obesity and lower insulin secretion and effectiveness found in Type II diabetics. Obesity is currently thought of as a cause, not an effect of, diabetes. Insulin normally controls blood sugar; in type II diabetes it becomes ineffective and blood sugar rises. Complications include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrene of the extremities.

Apparently, the Abu-Nidal group is not the only party responsible for the operation. An investigation revealed that the Fatah Revolutionary Council (FRC) carried out the assassination in coordination with the Jordanian fundamentalist Islamic Mobilization Youth Organization (IMYO). When IMYO was exposed, several terrorist groups moved to neighboring Arab countries; namely, Jordan and Iran. The assassination was intended as revenge against the Muslim Brotherhood Movement in Jordan, which did not agree with the extremism of other fundamentalists.\\nIntroduction:\\nIn less than one month, Lebanese security \\nauthorities in coordination with Jordanian authorities have \\nsucceeded in unraveling the mystery of the assassination of \\nJordanian diplomat Na\\'ib al- Ma\\'ayitah in Beirut on 29 January. \\nIt seems that the Abu-Nidal group is not the only party \\nresponsible for the operation. The file AL-WATAN AL-\\'ARABI has \\nobtained on the investigation confirms close cooperation and \\ncoordination between Fatah-the Revolutionary Council [FRC] and \\nJordanian fundamentalist extremist groups sponsored by Iran. In \\nthis investigative report AL-WATAN AL-\\'ARABI reveals the details \\nof this network, the secret meetings it held in Tehran, \\nAmsterdam, and Beirut, the names of those who planned and \\ncarried out the assassination, the centers where they were \\ntrained, their affiliations, and how this leads to exposing \\ndangerous secrets which made the Abu-Nidal group send threat \\nletters to those in charge of the investigation. \\n  A few days ago, Palestinian Ahmad Mahmud \\'Abd-al-Karim, a \\nprominent FRC official, arrived in Lebanon from Finland on the \\nspecial mission of following up the investigations the Lebanese \\nauthorities are conducting with the Palestinians from the \\nAbu-Nidal group who are accused of the assassination of \\nJordanian First Secretary Na\\'ib al-Ma\\'ayitah in Beirut on 29 \\nJanuary. \\n  Reports confirm that shortly after arriving in Beirut, Ahmad \\n\\'Abd-al-Karim left for the FRC\\'s al-Rawdah camps in Western \\nal-Biqa\\' from where he followed the investigation through \\nreports sent to him by people who secretly work for the FRC and \\nwho provided him with information in exchange for generous sums \\nof money. Reports say that some officials in the Lebanese \\nsecurity organs have links with the Abu-Nidal group. \\n  At the same time, AL-WATAN AL-\\'ARABI has learned that the \\nAbu- Nidal group recently sent threat letters to Lebanese \\nofficials who are currently investigating its members who are \\ninvolved in the al- Ma\\'ayitah assassination. These are: Yusuf \\nSha\\'ban, Bassam Muhammad \\'Attiyah, and Yusuf \\'Udwani, codenamed \\nSalim Mahyub. Lebanese investigator, Judge Sa\\'id Mirza ordered \\nthe arrest of the three Palestinians and listened to the \\ndeposition of three witnesses, including \\'Afaf Yusuf [not \\nfurther identified] who reiterated her previous deposition. \\nReports mention that the first steps in the investigation have \\nrevealed that the FRC planned and carried out the assassination \\nin coordination with the Jordanian fundamentalist Islamic \\nMobilization Youth Organization [IMYO] which is financed by Iran. \\n  The IMYO was exposed in Jordan by Jordanian authorities on \\n17 \\nAugust 1992 when the Jordanian security bodies confiscated \\nweapons and ammunition the organization had been hiding in \\nJordan to be used to destablize the regime and security in the \\ncountry. During the trials, this organization tried to claim \\nthat the weapons found by the authorities were temporarily \\nhidden in Jordan but were to be smuggled into the occupied \\nterritories and given to the Palestinian strugglers there to \\nenhance their ability to confront the Zionist forces and carry \\nout military operations against them. The IMYO also claimed \\nthat the weapons that were found were not brought in from any \\nneighboring country but were purchased on the local market. At \\nthe time, two members of Parliament were arrested; Ya\\'qub \\nQirrish anbd Layth Shubaylat on chrages of heading the \\norganization. \\n  The security information the investigators have collected on \\nthe al-Ma\\'ayitah assassination shows that as soon as the IMYO \\nwas exposed, Jordanian fundamentalist elements belonging to \\nvarious organizations such as Muhammad\\'s Army, the Islamic \\nLiberation Army, and the IMYO and others moved to neighboring \\nArab countries. Most of the factions left for Lebanon where \\nthey found the suitable atmosphere and the appropriate place to \\ncarry out their activities in cooperation with Hizballah. The \\ninformation gathered also shows that some Jordanian \\nfundamentalist elements moved to Iran where they received \\ntraining courses in the Al-Quds camp and the Kermandi [name as \\ntransliterated] camp, and courses in intelligence work in the \\nDarjah [name as transliterated] institute. Iran has sponsored \\nthese organizations to establish Islamic organizations and cells \\nin the countries that have common borders with Israel so they \\ncan take power in these countries and turn them into Islamic \\nregimes. \\n  Since that time, Iran exploited the elements from these \\nfundamentalist organizations and established the Jordan office \\nin the Liberation Movement\\'s office. Ayatollah Shakhiry [name \\nas transliterated], the official in charge of the Jordan section \\nin the Iranian intelligence organ, took charge of this office. \\n  Confirmed information indicates that in early 1994, IMYO \\nelements held an important meeting in Amsterdam, the \\nNetherlands, with officials from the FRC. The official in \\ncharge of the Jordanian elements was Shakir Abu-Jami\\', a \\nJordanian national wanted by authorities in his country and one \\nof the most prominent members of the Jordanian fundamentalist \\nMuhammad Army Organization. Abu-Jami\\' now lives in Sa\\'dah, \\nYemen, which is home to camps for Afghan and Arab \\nfundamentalists. \\n  The information adds that the IMYO made several decisions to \\nattack Jordanian interests and institutions and assassinate \\nJordanian diplomats in a move to pressure the Jordanian regime. \\nThe information says that the scheme was designed some two \\nyears ago and the Muslim Brotherhood Movement in Jordan refused \\nto get involved in it because of the danger and because the \\nBrotherhood Movement does not agree with the proposals of other \\nfundamentalist organizations. \\n  Iran managed to recruit FRC members to work in the Jordanian \\nfundamentalist extremist organizations by taking advantage of \\nthe hostility the Abu-Nidal group has harbored against Jordan \\nand its regime and king ever since the group was expelled from \\nthe country. The information confirms that Abu-Nidal group\\'s \\nleadership agreed to execute the mission for the aforesaid \\nreasons, because of its commitment to the policy of extremism \\nand rejection that aims at torpedoing the [peace] process, and \\nbecause of its ties to Iran within the framework of \\ninternational terrorism. \\n  Detailing this cooperation that lead to al-Ma\\'ayitah\\'s \\nassassination, the security sources note that the al-Ramlah al- \\nBayda\\' area in Beirut contained a secret headquarters for Walid \\nKhalid, the FRC official spokesman who was assassinated in the \\nLebanese capital on 30 July 1992. These meetings were conducted \\nin the presence of an FRC official called Amjad \\'Ata, a Lebanese \\nmember of Abu-Nidal group named Tha\\'ir, and a Jordanian IMYO \\nofficial from the Idkaydik family. The plan to assassinate \\nal-Ma\\'ayitah was drafted during these meetings. \\n  But why did the Abu-Nidal group and the IMYO choose to \\nassassinate Na\\'ib al-Ma\\'ayitah and not any other Jordanian \\nofficial in the Beirut embassy. \\n  To carry out the assassination, an intensive training course \\nwas conducted for the Palestinians Bassam \\'Atiyah and Yusuf \\n\\'Adwani in a secret center run by Abu-Nidal group in Buq\\'atah in \\nLebanon\\'s al- Shuf area under the supervision of a Palestinian \\nexpert in assassinations called A. al-\\'Umayri [not further \\nidentified]. Al- \\'Umayri was implicated in the assassination of \\nthe FRC official Bahij Abu-al-Hana in July 1992 in Lebanon\\'s \\nal-Biqa\\' area, after he accused him of contacting the \\n\\'Arafat-led Fatah movement. \\n  Confirmed security information says a Jordanian \\nfundamentalist took part in the assassination of al-Ma\\'ayitah. \\nHe was charged with observation and backup when the \\nassassination was carried out. The man is called Khalid \\nal-Bishtawi, 34 years old. The security agencies\\' information \\nsuggests that al-Bishtawi fled to Burj al- Barajinah camp after \\nthe crime and then moved to Cyprus where he joined Jordanian \\nfundamentalist elements living there with Tunisian \\nfundamentalists from the Rachid Ghanouchi-led al-Nahdah Movement. \\n  The FRC (Abu-Nidal group) took immediate steps after al- \\nMa\\'ayitah\\'s assassination. It made changes within the ranks of \\nits officials and moved some of them outside Lebanon and changed \\nthe secret apartments it owns in Beirut and the southern part of \\nSidon. \\n  It is worth noting that the Jordanian intelligence service \\nplayed an important role in revealing the secrets and details of \\nal- Ma\\'ayitah\\'s assassination. Jordanian security officials \\ntraveled to Lebanon and cooperated with Lebanese officers in the \\ninvestigations that led to revealing all the details and the \\narrest of more than 30 members of Abu-Nidal group in Jordan. It \\nseems that the investigations will not stop at this point in \\nBeirut or Amman. \\n  In an apparent attempt to prevent the revelation of further \\ndetails, the leadership of the Abu-Nidal group urged King Husayn \\nto \"give it a chance to explain its position.\" It also \\nhastened to send one of its officials to Lebanon to follow the \\ninvestigation and try to lessen its repercussions out of fear \\nthat al-Ma\\'ayitah\\'s assassination may be one of the fatal \\nmistakes committed by the FRC and may negatively affect the \\norganization\\'s future in Lebanon and Jordan. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nMadison, Florida, a town of 3500 people, is about fifty miles east of Tallahassee.

Thirteen states are now involved. A White House spokesman said the drought would drive up food prices, but not have overall implications for the economy. There was speculation that the export enhancement program would be curbed and embargos placed on soybean exports. Bankers are concerned about payments on farm loans and fewer loan applications. Farm equipment makers fear sales will drop, while realtors fear an end to the land boom.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nThe Reagan administration moved to deal with the worsening drought, and a top trade official said that farm export subsidies may have to be curbed. \\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, fears mounted that the fragile recovery of agriculture-related industries will be derailed by continuing lack of rain. \\n\\n\\nConcern that the drought could fuel inflation drove stocks and bonds sharply lower yesterday. \\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 37.16 points to close at 2094.24, while U.S. government bonds fell more than 1 1/2 points. \\nGrain and soybean futures continued their drought-driven rally. \\n\\n\\nPresident Reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government\\'s Conservation Reserve Program. \\n\\n\\nWhite House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the president is \"very concerned\" about the drought, and \"wants to make certain that everything that the federal government can do to assist will be done.\" \\n\\n\\nWhile he wouldn\\'t predict what kind of disaster relief might be authorized, Mr. Fitzwater said the drought \"certainly is going to drive up food prices. \\nWe\\'ve already seen some increases in some products.\" \\nBut he said the administration doesn\\'t believe the drought will have \"overall implications for the economy.\" \\n\\n\\nAt a news briefing, Special Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter warned that the administration may have to curb its so-called export enhancement program if the drought becomes even worse. \\nThis program is designed to boost farm exports by reimbursing U.S. exporters for the difference between the prices they receive for grain and other commodities in world markets and higher U.S. prices. \\n\\n\\n\"Clearly, we will have to appraise very carefully the desirability of using export enhancement funds at a time when (U.S.) supplies are unpredictable,\" Mr. Yeutter said. \\n\\n\\nShrinking soybean stockpiles and soaring prices have stirred speculation that the government may impose an embargo on exports of soybeans and soybean products. \\nGrowers still complain about the 1973 embargo, which they say hurt the nation\\'s reputation as a reliable supplier. \\n\\n\\nBut Mr. Yeutter said he would \"vigorously\" oppose any embargo on U.S. soybean exports. \\nEarlier this week, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng took an equally adamant stand against such an embargo. \\n\\n\\nBefore the drought began damaging crops this month, the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers. \\nHefty government subsidies on last year\\'s strong harvests put a record amount of cash into farmers pockets. \\n\\n\\nBut bankers that lend to farmers suddenly are worrying anew about their borrower\\'s financial health. \\nFarm equipment makers say they are concerned that sales could suffer. \\nRealtors in rural areas say that land prices, which had just begun to turn around, may be affected. \\n\\n\\nFor many, the drought couldn\\'t come at a worse time. \\n\"This is probably putting a damper on one of the most optimistic years in the last eight years,\" says Richard Hahn, president and chief executive of an Omaha, Neb.-based farm management concern. \\n\\n\\nIn April, the price of good-quality Iowa farm land was one-third higher than it was a year earlier. \\nTractor sales by farm equipment dealers were up 12.8% during the first five months of the year. \\n\\n\\nNow, with farmers in many Midwest states expecting smaller harvests this year, these businesses are seeing their new-found trade evaporating. \\n\\n\\n\"Everybody is watching the dollars they have,\" says Allen Olson, a vice president of the National Bank of Harvey, N.D., where the drought has already halved the potential yield of the local wheat crop. \\n\"People are borrowing minimal amounts.\" \\n\\n\\nFew in farming expect the drought to trigger an agricultural recession, although more farmers could go bankrupt because of it. \\nBut all bets are off on how farmers will fare at the end of this year\\'s harvests. \\nWhile crop prices are soaring on weather-worries, yields may be so low in many areas that farmers won\\'t do nearly as well as expected. \\n\\n\\nIf farmers are strapped for cash this year, the effects would ripple throughout the farm economy. \\nBob Pfiefer, owner of a Massey-Ferguson farm equipment dealership in Sioux Falls, S.D., says he has already canceled some orders for fear that sales will soon begin dropping off. \\nIf the drought continues, he says, \"it could bring us to our knees again.\" \\n\\n\\nIn Franklin, Tenn., implement dealer Larry Holt is slashing his fall orders by one-third, even though sales so far this year are up roughly 25%. \\nHe expects sales for the rest of this year to drop 10% to 20% from the second-half of 1987. \\n\\n\\nJ.I. Case, the farm implement-making unit of Tenneco Inc., is considering cutting production schedules if the drought continues through July. \\n\"It\\'s already getting harder to sell farmers tractors because of the drought,\" says James K. Ashford, Case president and chief executive officer. \\nHe said that if the drought continues, industrywide tractor sales could turn flat next year instead of climbing the 5% to 6% that was originally forecast for 1989. \\n\\n\\nAmong rural banks, loan problems are expected to rise and profits to fall. \\n\"Before the drought we expected a very solid year\" for farm lenders, says Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank. \\n\"There are a lot of question marks right now.\" \\n\\n\\nMany rural lenders this spring were banking on farmers losing some of their post-farm crisis inhibitions about going into hock. \\nOne of the biggest problems for farm banks has been that their number of loans, a major source of bank income, has shriveled as farmers paid off their debts with last year\\'s profits. \\n\\n\\nIn Anadarko, Okla., bankers worry now that ranchers are going to make less money this year because crop damage is escalating the cost of feeding cattle. \\n\"The drought is going to hurt us because it hurts the cattle market,\" says Lance Shenold, a vice president of Anadarko Bank &amp; Trust Co. \\n\\n\\nThe land boom is wilting. \\nBecause of the drought, Iowa realtors expect land prices to rise somewhat less than the 5% to 10% they had been expecting. \\n\"Everybody has just kind of pulled in their horns,\" says Jim Frevert, vice president of Hertz Farm Management Inc., Nevada, Iowa. \\n\\n\\nA big drop in harvests this year could squeeze investors who had planned on good yields to help pay their real estate loans. \\nMost of the farmers who have bought land recently did so for cash, but many of the urban investors got in on credit, real estate agents say. \\n\\n\\nAmong all the uncertainty, however, some are looking for a silver lining. \\n\"I will be hurt a bit,\" says Mark Dadd, an economist who is buying a 420-acre farm in Missouri. \\n\"But I regard this as a distinctly positive thing.\" \\nHe is hoping that drought damage and rising crop prices will fan inflationary fears so high that land again will be a hot commodity. \\n\"I\\'m here for the capital gain over the long haul,\" he says. \\n\\n\\nThe drought is also fanning wildly different predictions of how the farm economy will turn next year. \\nSome economists think high crop prices will spark more planting, which would benefit agribusiness, while others think farmers will start the next growing season more conservative. \\n\\n\\nPaul Prentice of Farm Sector Economics Associates, a forecasting concern, thinks the drought could so deplete U.S. stockpiles that the Agriculture Department would drop much of its farm crisis-era planting restrictions. \\nHe is projecting that the number of acres planted with corn could rise by about one-fifth and soybean acreage could increase by one-sixth. \\n\\n\\nOthers, however, see little chance that recession-weary farmers would be willing to take the risk of planting fence-row to fence-row like they did a decade ago. \\n\"I don\\'t see us getting on a late \\'70s bandwagon,\" says Mr. Drabenstott of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank. \\n\"Both borrowers and lenders have developed pretty good memories.\" \\n\\n\\nThe decision by Mr. Lyng, the secretary of agriculture, to allow hay-mowing for 30 days on Conservation Reserve Program land came as farmers and ranchers in North Dakota, Minnesota and other states continued to sell off livestock in response to shortages of hay and other forage crops. \\nNationwide, pasture conditions on June 1 were the worst they have been since 1934, according to the Agriculture Department. \\n\\n\\nMr. Lyng\\'s order covers counties where livestock-grazing and hay-mowing on so-called set-aside acres already has been authorized, and the drought\\'s effects have been rated as \"severe.\" \\nEvery county in North Dakota meets these criteria. \\n\\n\\nThe department said it won\\'t allow livestock-grazing on land in the soil-conservation program, under which farmers are paid to take erodible acreage out of crop production. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Census head count will begin on April 1, 1990. These figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats and to distribute federal aid to local governments. Aliens have been counted in the past but military personal stationed overseas have not. The Census Department and the Department of Defense are devising a plan to count the military and determine which states may count them. Census officials contend that they have no way to determine who is in the country legally. It would be difficult to get aliens to tell the truth or participate in the census at all if they were asked about their status.\\nIntroduction:\\n   A major issue hanging over the 1990 Census is\\nresolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed\\noverseas, but Congress is arguing over whether to keep counting\\nillegal aliens.\\n   The House blocked an effort Tuesday to require aliens to be\\nexcluded from the census numbers used in House reapportionment\\nevery decade. But the question still may be raised in committee and\\nin the Senate.\\n   The national head count will be taken April 1, 1990. Census\\nfigures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among the\\nstates every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local\\ngovernments.\\n   The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of House\\nmembers from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses\\nof House seats. Most of these states are in the North, where growth\\nhas lagged behind that of the South and West.\\n   Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, West\\nand industrial states like New York, and other states fear a loss\\nof power to those areas if the aliens are counted.\\n   While aliens have been counted in the past, military personnel\\nstationed overseas have not.\\n   The Commerce Department settled that problem by announcing it\\nwill work with the Defense Department on ways to count the 1.2\\nmillion to 1.6 million military and civilian defense workers who\\nlive overseas.\\n   The problem has been in deciding which states may count these\\npeople as residents. That has yet to be decided, but possibilities\\ninclude counting the state where the person owns a home or the last\\nstate where he or she lived for at least six months.\\n   The battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both in\\ncommittee and on the House floor.\\n   Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on\\ncounting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 million\\nto run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year,\\nincluding $800 million to take the census. The bill was approved\\n258-165 and sent to the Senate.\\n   Opponents noted the Constitution requires House seats to be\\napportioned based on all the ``persons\\'\\' residing in a state.\\n   ``Every census since the Constitution was created has counted\\nall residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,\\'\\'\\nobserved Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.\\n   ``Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted\\'\\' in the\\ncensus, responded Ridge. The Census Bureau\\'s $4 billion budget for\\nthe census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal\\naliens, he said.\\n   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really over\\npopulation shifts that will lead to more House seats for southern\\nand western states.\\n   ``Pennsylvania, I don\\'t care what they do, unless they go down\\nto the Southwest and bring the people back, they\\'re going to lose a\\nseat,\\'\\' said Dymally.\\n   Rep.

While laws baring first-time candidates from running have been invalidated, state laws limiting tenure of congressional officeholders have not been tested. Florida will provide an opinion later in the month. California\\'s limit on state terms has been upheld. Term limits do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his ideology and candidates may be elected to a different office or re-elected to the same office after a waiting period. Term limits also do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held that the states have the power to regulate elections.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nIf Washington state imposes term limits on its\\ncongressional delegation Tuesday, the issue of whether or not\\nsuch limits are constitutional will take center stage. Many\\nlawyers and political scientists say no, arguing that neither\\nCongress nor the states may add to the age, citizenship and\\nresidency qualifications set forth in the Constitution.\\n\\nBut critics of state-imposed term limits on Congress miss\\nthe point. Term limits do not add another \"qualification\" for\\nservice in Congress. They do not prevent anyone from having\\nan opportunity to serve in Congress. They merely prevent a\\nperson who has already served a certain number of consecutive\\nterms in office from serving another consecutive term.\\n\\nState statutes that bar first-time candidates from running\\nfor Congress have been held to add to the qualifications set\\nforth in the Constitution and have been invalidated. For\\nexample, the 1972 decision in Dillon v. Fiorina struck down a\\nNew Mexico law requiring candidates entering a congressional\\nprimary to have belonged to their party for a year and to pay\\na registration fee. But state statutes that simply limit the\\ntenure of existing congressional officeholders have not yet\\nbeen tested in court.\\n\\nThe constitutionality of such state term limits may,\\nhowever, be tested next month. Florida\\'s attorney general has\\nasked its state Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on a\\nterm-limit initiative that would limit the state\\'s members of\\nCongress to eight consecutive years in office. Three U.S.\\nHouse members, led by Democrat Larry Smith, have filed briefs\\nasking the court to rule state term limits unconstitutional.\\nThe court will hear arguments Friday, and may rule later this\\nmonth.\\n\\nBy 6 to 1, the California Supreme Court ruled this month\\nthat the state\\'s new term-limit law was constitutional. The\\ncourt said the \"state\\'s strong interests in protecting\\nagainst an entrenched, dynastic legislative bureaucracy\"\\noutweighed objections that term limits restrict voter choice\\nat the ballot box. But the court\\'s decision affected only\\nterm limits on state officials; federal officeholders weren\\'t\\nincluded in California\\'s limits.\\n\\nNevertheless, the California decision demolished many of\\nthe legal arguments made by incumbents. They claimed there is\\na \"fundamental right to be a candidate for public office,\"\\nwhich they found among the \"associational rights\" in the\\nFirst Amendment. They argued that voters were denied the\\nright to be represented by the same legislator indefinitely,\\nand that term limits discriminated against incumbents and\\ndenied them their right to equal protection of the laws.\\nCalifornia\\'s highest court rejected all of these arguments.\\n\\nTerm limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a\\ncandidate because of his or her ideology or party. Therefore,\\nthey do not deprive voters of the freedom to associate with\\ncandidates based on their viewpoint or with any particular\\nparty. Rather, they prevent citizens from voting for a\\nparticular candidate after he has served in office a set\\nnumber of years. They may vote for that candidate again after\\na \"waiting period\" has ended. The restriction is imposed in a\\nnon-discriminatory manner on all candidates regardless of\\nviewpoint or party affiliation.\\n\\nIn its 1972 decision Bullock v. Carter and again in its\\n1982 decision Clements v. Fashing, the U.S. Supreme Court\\ndetermined that a particular candidate has no \"fundamental\"\\nright to ballot access or to run for office. Federal courts\\nhave upheld many state restrictions on who may qualify for\\nballot access. They have never held reasonable,\\nnon-discriminatory restrictions on who may run a violation of\\nthe right to vote.\\n\\nLikewise, term limits do not violate the Equal Protection\\nClause of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court has found\\nthat clause violated only in those cases where ballot access\\nrestrictions discriminate against the poor and against new,\\nsmall or independent party candidates.\\n\\nUnlike the age, residency and citizenship requirements,\\nterm limits do not prevent any non-incumbent from running for\\nCongress. Nor do they prevent a House member who has reached\\na term limit from running for the U.S. Senate or vice versa.\\nNor do they limit an incumbent who leaves office for a period\\nof time (six years in Washington state) from running again.\\nMoreover, term limits do not in any way modify the age,\\nresidency or citizenship requirements in the Constitution.\\nConsequently, the argument that term limits are\\n\"qualifications\" just like those already in the Constitution\\n-- and that therefore they can be added only by amending the\\nConstitution -- isn\\'t particularly convincing. Viewed in this\\nway, term limits imposed by states would be constitutional.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court has long held that the power to ensure a\\nfair electoral system, truly responsive representation in\\nCongress and a high degree of citizen participation in\\nelections rests with the states. In its 1974 decision Storer\\nv. Brown, the Supreme Court upheld a California law that\\nprohibited an independent candidate from running for Congress\\nbecause he had changed his registration to Independent less\\nthan 11 months before the election. This law was found not to\\nbe an improper additional qualification because a valid state\\ninterest was pursued.\\n\\nIn explaining that interest, the court recognized that\\n\"there must be a substantial regulation of elections {by the\\nstates} if they are to be fair and honest,\" and if some sort\\nof order is to accompany the democratic process. As recently\\nas June of this year, the Supreme Court again reiterated that\\nthe states have reserved to themselves, via the Tenth\\nAmendment, \"the power to regulate elections.\"\\n\\nElsewhere, the court in 1988 ruled in South Carolina v.\\nBaker, that certain \"extraordinary defects in the national\\npolitical process might render congressional regulation of\\nstate activities invalid under the Tenth Amendment.\" The\\ncourt has not defined what it means by \"extraordinary\\ndefects,\" but surely the fact that 98% of House incumbents\\nare routinely re-elected and that one out of five incumbents\\nran with no major-party opposition in 1990 might qualify.\\nWhere the incumbent is almost the pre-ordained winner in an\\nelection, there is no effective competition of ideas or\\ncandidates and incumbents are less responsive to the will of\\nthe electorate. On this basis, term limits merely ensure a\\nfair election system and the \"republican form of government\"\\nguaranteed the states under the Constitution.\\n\\nShould the court rule against term limits by the states,\\nnumerous other ballot access restrictions will likely be\\npassed that have many of the same effects as term limits. One\\noption would limit an incumbents\\' access to the ballot.\\nStates could allow an incumbent who has served a set number\\nof years in the same office to run again, but only as a\\n\"write-in\" candidate. Presumably, if an incumbent were truly\\neffective and popular he wouldn\\'t find that a crushing\\nobstacle. Two sitting U.S. House Members won their first\\nterms as write-in candidates. Incumbents would certainly have\\nthe resources to educate voters in write-in procedures.\\n\\nAnother option would require candidates to have \"ballot\\nstatements\" appear next to their names. Each candidate would\\nhave to answer the question: \"Will you adhere to a -- year\\nterm limit?\" The answer would appear on the ballot so voters\\nwould know a candidate\\'s views on term limits. Many such\\nballot restrictions have been upheld by the courts.\\n\\nIncumbents should take heed. If they count only on the\\ncourts to safeguard their political castles, they may be in\\nfor a rude surprise.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nSouth Africa\\'s De Beers Consolidated Mines, which controls 80% of the world diamond market through its London-based Central Selling Organization, is raising its diamond prices an average 10%. Rough diamonds were already trading at a premium over De Beers\\' own quotes on the open market, especially in the Far East. In Japan, the second biggest diamond-jewelry market after the US, appreciation of the yen reduced diamonds\\' cost. Per-carat prices of D-flawless diamonds have risen to $14,800 from $12,000 since the beginning of the year. De Beers revived diamond trade from an early-80s slump through an aggressive marketing campaign and withholding stocks.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nFlexing its muscles as a cartel, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. is raising its diamond prices an average 10% next month. \\n\\n\\nThe South African concern, which controls 80% of the world diamond market through its London-based Central Selling Organization, sells a vast array of diamonds, varying in quality and size, dealers say. \\nSo the increase could be as much as 20% on top-grade diamonds. \\nThe rise follows an average price increase of 14.5% last year. \\n\\n\\n\"The diamond price increase was expected,\" said Jacques Zucker, of Lachowsky Zucker, diamond dealers in Antwerp, Belgium. \\nBy changing the mix of diamonds that it sells to dealers several months ago, De Beers signaled to the market that it intended to raise quotes, he said. \\n\\n\\n\"Few listened to us two years ago when we advised clients to buy diamonds at depressed values,\" Mr. Zucker said. \\n\"Now they must accept higher prices.\" \\n\\n\\n\"The price rise provides the necessary psychological lift to the market,\" said Peter Miller, a mining analyst at Shearson Lehman Securities in London. \\nIt will help the diamond producers \"consolidate their gains.\" \\n\\n\\nPrices of one-carat D-flawless diamonds have risen to about $14,800 a carat from $12,000 at the beginning of the year, dealers said. \\nIn 1985, at the low point of a deep slump, a top quality stone was $8,500 a carat, down from an average of $55,000 in 1980. \\nA carat equals 200 milligrams. \\n\\n\\nDe Beers decided to raise prices because rough diamonds were already trading at a premium over its own quotes on the open market, said Andrew Lamont, a company spokesman. \\nDemand is especially buoyant in the Far East. \\nIn the first seven months of 1987, Japanese imports of polished diamonds surged 60% from the similar period last year to $777 million, he added. \\n\\n\\nAfter the U.S., Japan is the second biggest diamond jewelry market, followed by West Germany. \\nOnly one out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings less than two decades ago; now more than two-thirds buy. \\n\\n\\n\"The sharp appreciation of the yen reduced the cost of diamonds for Japanese buyers,\" Mr. Lamont says. \\nStronger currencies and lower interest rates in West Germany and other European countries also boosted diamond sales, he says. \\nDiamonds are priced in U.S. dollars. \\n\\n\\nDemand for polished diamonds in the U.S., Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, and the Philippines also raised exports of the leading diamond cutting and dealing centers, primarily Antwerp, Tel Aviv, Bombay and New York. \\n\\n\\nTo meet growing orders from diamond dealers and cutters who supply the retail trade, De Beers sales of rough diamonds jumped to $1.56 billion in the first half of this year from $1.2 billion in the similar period in 1986. \\n\\n\\nSales of $2.56 billion last year were the highest since the 1980 boom when De Beers turnover reached $2.72 billion. \\nAnalysts are predicting sales of $3 billion in 1987. \\n\\n\\nYet some dealers worry because world diamond production surged to 89.6 million carats last year from 47 million carats in 1982. \\nOnly about 10% to 20% of the diamonds are gems, but De Beers must continue to find new markets, they say. \\n\\n\\nDe Beers surprised skeptics and revived trade from the slump in the first half of the decade by withholding stocks and pursuing an intensive marketing campaign. \\n\\n\\nAn advertising and promotion budget which rose to $110 million this year from $43 million in 1980 helped raise world-wide sales of diamond jewelry to a record 49 million pieces valued at $24.6 billion last year. \\nIn 1979, about 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion were sold, De Beers says. \\n\\n\\nIn more than half a century of its existence, the Central Selling Organization, which includes as members black African state producers, has outlasted other commodity cartels by never cutting diamond prices. \\n\\n\\nThe cartel controls most of the world\\'s rough diamond market via a \"pipeline\" that stretches from mines in Africa to Australia to diamond dealers and cutters. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nA two seat T-2 Buckeye jet trainer crashed Sunday on the flight deck of the carrier Lexington as it was cruising 17 miles south of Pensacola, Florida.

After a faltering initial response, the administration is getting assistance to the hurricane\\'s victims. Earlier the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the ultimate Republican patronage backwater, was caught completely unprepared by Andrew. Now the Transportation Secretary and Chief of Staff have jumped in to fill the breach. The president has dispatched troops to Florida, promised to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, and has committed the government to pay the emergency relief costs. The latest polls show Bush closing the gap in his campaign for re-election.\\nIntroduction:\\nTHERE are growing signs that Hurricane Andrew, unwelcome as it was for the\\ndevastated inhabitants of Florida and Louisiana, may in the end do no harm\\nto the re-election campaign of President George Bush.\\nAfter a faltering and heavily criticised initial response to the disaster,\\nboth the president and his administration seem finally to be getting\\nassistance to those rendered homeless and to businesses and farms that have\\nbeen destroyed.\\nIn the process, Mr Bush has been able to call on the power of incumbency,\\nthe one asset denied his presidential rival, Mr Bill Clinton, who is to\\nvisit Florida today. This was brought home graphically by the president\\'s\\nannouncement that Homestead Air Force base in Florida - a major local\\nemployer virtually destroyed by Andrew  - would be rebuilt.\\nHis poignant and brief address to the nation on Tuesday night, committing\\nthe government to pay the emergency relief costs and calling on Americans to\\ncontribute to the American Red Cross, also struck the right sort of note. It\\nwas only his tenth such televised speech from the Oval Office, itself a\\ntestimony to the gravity of the situation.\\nAs if to underline the political benefit to the president, a Harris poll\\nconducted from August 26 to September 1 yesterday showed Mr Bush with 45 per\\ncent support - behind Mr Clinton by just five points - reflecting a closer\\nrace than other recent surveys.\\nWith Mr Bush constantly in the headlines, Mr Clinton has been left on the\\nsidelines, able to do little more than offer sympathy and sotto voce\\ncriticism of the president\\'s initial stumbling.\\nFirst responses were certainly found wanting, specifically in the\\nperformance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) set up by\\nPresident Carter in 1979 to handle disasters such as Andrew. FEMA has, under\\nthe Republicans, become the ultimate patronage backwater, with, according to\\none congressional study, ten times as many political appointees as the\\ntypical arm of government.\\nIts current head, Mr Wallace Stickney, is a New Hampshire political\\nassociate of Mr John Sununu, the former state governor and White House chief\\nof staff. Contrary to its brief, but confirming a prescient recent report by\\na House committee that Mr Stickney was \\'uninterested in substantive\\nprogrammes\\', FEMA was caught completely unprepared by Andrew, resulting in\\nunseemly disputes between state and federal authorities over who did what in\\nbringing relief.\\nHowever, the arrival in Florida of the military and the assignment of\\nspecial responsibilities to Mr Andrew Card, the young and telegenic\\ntransportation secretary, is making a difference. Also increasingly evident\\nis the hand of Mr James Baker, now ensconced at the White House.\\nIt was Mr Baker who reshuffled the president\\'s campaign schedule to make\\nroom for visits to the devastated areas and who pushed for a bigger role for\\nthe previously obscure Mr Card. It is also Mr Baker who is making the most\\nof presidential powers to dispense largesse.\\nYesterday, Mr Bush flew to South Dakota to tell farmers of an expansion of\\nthe subsidised grains exports programme and then to the General Dynamics\\nfactory in Texas to announce an F-16 fighter sale to Taiwan. Both are, of\\ncourse, intensely political actions. Both involve federal subsidies, as does\\nrelief for Andrew, that run counter to Mr Bush\\'s commitment to reduce the\\nbudget deficit. But both may be presented by a president as being in the\\nnational interest because they guarantee employment, which is what the\\nelection is largely about.\\nUS insurers expect to pay out around Dollars 500m in claims as a result of\\ndamage caused by Hurricane Andrew in Louisiana, the American Insurance\\nServices Group said yesterday, Nikki Tait reports. This takes the insurance\\nbill from the storm to around Dollars 8bn, making it the costliest disaster\\nto hit the US.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nPentagon and Air Force officials announced that regular training flight schedules for aircraft participating in Operation Desert Shield would resume on Thursday. It is estimated that the order covered 700 aircraft. Aircraft training operations had been suspended for 24 hours following a rash of accidents. Five United States aircraft have been involved in fatal crashes since the start of Desert Shield. They are identified as an F-111, an F-4 reconnaissance jet, an F-15E and two HU-1 Huey helicopters. In addition, a C-5 transport that crashed in Germany was ferrying supplies to Saudi Arabia.\\nIntroduction:\\n   U.S. Air Force war planes participating in\\nOperation Desert Shield are flying again after they were ordered\\ngrounded for 24 hours following a rash of crashes.\\n   Pentagon and Air Force officials said regular training flight\\nschedules resumed Thursday at noon local time (5 a.m. EDT). The\\nflights account for a majority of U.S. air missions in the Persian\\nGulf region.\\n   The Air Force ``has not changed anything\\'\\' in flight operations\\nas a result of the suspension of flights, Capt.

This system is a means of investment using small loans to poor women to finance their own private enterprise, e.g., selling produce, crafts, etc. This arrangement allows them to create savings while paying interest and thereby qualifying for larger loans. The \"village banking\" system has grown to nine countries. Hatch says he created the system in order to channel money to the poor, primarily the mothers of children who would otherwise starve to death. The women have a loan repayment rate of nearly 100 percent.\\nIntroduction:\\n   John Hatch, founder of the non-profit Foundation\\nfor International Community Assistance, promotes village banking to\\nencourage private enterprise in the Third World. What he foresees\\nis a body blow to world poverty through bootstrap economics.\\n   John Hatch says he hit upon his Third World\\n``poverty vaccination\\'\\' while panic-stricken on a flight to Bolivia.\\n   He had decided he could not comply with requirements of a\\nconsulting job he had accepted from the Agency for International\\nDevelopment, and he was scrambling to come up with a suitable\\nsubstitute.\\n   ``And on my second double bourbon at 35,000 feet up flying over\\nthe Andes, I have to say it was like this thought just rolled\\nthrough my body,\\'\\' Hatch recalls. ``I had my calculator out and I\\nwas sketching this thing and I was doing numbers, and I arrived in\\nLa Paz with a full-blown concept.\\'\\'\\n   What he had stumbled upon was village banking, a system of\\ninvestment using small revolving loans to poor women to finance\\ntheir private enterprise, allowing them to create savings while\\npaying interest and qualifying for bigger loans.\\n   The series of loans, starting at $50, is renewable over three\\nyears to a ceiling of $300, allowing recipients to reach a level at\\nwhich they can qualify for commercial credit.\\n   What Hatch envisioned on that plane five years ago has\\ntranslated into 400 village banks in nine countries with more than\\n35,000 members. Portfolios total $1.6 million, with a 96 percent\\nrepayment rate. Village banks are operating in Mexico, Haiti,\\nThailand, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Peru and El\\nSalvador.\\n   The concept is similar to the one behind the Grameen Bank of\\nBangladesh: channeling money to the impoverished, principally\\nmothers, without the demands of commercial banks for collateral, so\\nthey can improve their families\\' lives.\\n   What Hatch foresees is a body blow to world poverty through\\nbootstrap economics.\\n   Hatch, a one-time Peace Corps volunteer with a doctorate in\\neconomic development, is founder and president of the non-profit\\nFoundation for International Community Assistance, which recently\\nmoved its headquarters from Tucson to Alexandria, Va.\\n   He says its impetus was, and remains, the thousands of children\\nworldwide who die daily because of starvation, what he calls the\\nsacrifice of ``probably our most precious resource.\\'\\'\\n   Hatch focuses on reaching mothers in the belief that\\nstrengthening them economically lets them care for their children\\nbetter. There is ``almost a 100 percent guarantee\\'\\' that increased\\nincome for women will go into improvements in their children\\'s\\nwelfare, Hatch says.\\n   ``We teach severely poor mothers how to create their own\\nself-managed bank, which provides them with self-employment loans,\\nprovides them with savings incentives and provides them with a\\nsupport group of mothers like themselves, so that they are all\\nattacking change at the same time.\\'\\'\\n   Lawrence Yanovitch, small enterprise development program\\ncoordinator for Catholic Relief Services in Baltimore, Md., says,\\n``John Hatch is close to the voice of the poor. Though he\\'s come up\\nwith some sophisticated economic tools, he\\'s kept the\\nhumanitarianism.\\'\\'\\n   Catholic Relief Services entered a five-year, $1 million joint\\nventure a year ago with the U.S. Agency for International\\nDevelopment and the foundation to create 40 village banks in\\nThailand.\\n   They targeted microenterprise development through small\\nentrepreneurs, vendors, village market women, who in some\\ndeveloping countries comprise up to 50 percent of the employment.\\n   Capitalization for one bank typically will cost a sponsoring\\nagency $5,000.\\n   Beryl Rupp, a Rotary Club official in Phoenix, says the bank\\nmembers buy necessities with their profits or savings: a chair to\\nsit on, pots to cook in, blankets, better food.\\n   The women, when asked, speak of the greatest benefit in terms of\\nwhat Hatch calls ``empowerment perceptions.\\'\\'\\n   ``They say things like, `Now I\\'m somebody,\\' or `My husband\\nrespects me more.\\'\\'\\'\\n   Their vehicle for improvement is the village bank, each\\ncomprised of 30 to 50 women who, through loans starting at $50, can\\nearn enough to provide savings and create capital. Hatch says the\\nloans give them freedom to start their own investment projects in\\nor near home.\\n   The foundation will go into a village with a joint-venture\\npartner that puts up at least half of the capitalization, such as\\nRotary Clubs or Catholic Relief Services, and identify a key woman.\\nShe then contacts others to attend an organizing meeting.\\n   ``Forget the mayor, forget the priest, forget the chief,\\'\\' Hatch\\nsays. ``We want to know who the most powerful woman is in that\\nvillage.\\'\\'\\n   At the meeting, the women circle illustrated examples of\\nquick-turnover work they want the loans to finance. It might be\\nselling produce, groceries, baked goods, raising chickens, sewing\\nor craftwork.\\n   Each woman signs her name or provides a thumbprint as\\ncollateral, agreeing to repay one-sixteenth of the loan weekly,\\nplus interest of 1 percent to 3 percent, in line with local banks.\\nIn some countries, the repayment rate has been 100 percent.\\nOverall, the average is 97 percent, says Hatch.\\n   ``Fifty percent or more are illiterate, and I would say 90\\npercent of them don\\'t have any idea of what they\\'re getting into\\nwhen we start out,\\'\\' says Hatch. ``And yet within 16 weeks they\\'re\\nall experts. They just learn as they go.\\'\\'\\n   Women who join the bank screen members and elect their leaders\\nfrom first-meeting attendees.\\n   At the end of the 16th week, each member\\'s loan balance is zero.\\nBut at the same time, each woman has been depositing weekly savings\\nof at least 20 percent of the original loan. The savings serve as\\nincentive for subsequent loans by increasing the credit line each\\ntime, Hatch said.\\n   Interest in village banking is mounting.\\n   The United Nations has provided a $50,000 grant to research the\\neffects of women\\'s empowerment through village banking on maternal\\nand child health practices.\\n   The foundation has major proposals pending with the Agency for\\nInternational Development, the Ford Foundation, Citibank and the\\nChase Manhattan Bank, among others.\\n   Rotary Club 100, a Phoenix organization, and a Rotary Club of\\nMexico City are in a joint venture, having funded five village\\nbanks in Guaymas, Mexico, with another four to be launched in the\\nslums of Mexico City.\\n   Hatch says he believes village banking has a role to play in\\nreducing poverty along the Mexican border and in slowing down\\nmigration to this country.\\n   As for whether such a system could work in the United States,\\nRotary\\'s Rupp says, ``Frankly, it\\'s the only hope we have of\\nchanging the welfare system.\\'\\'\\n   ``Ultimately the way out of poverty is savings,\\'\\' Hatch adds.\\n``It\\'s got to be built on the back of their own savings.\\'\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nTen months after the Christopher Commission called for the resignation of Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, he has finally agreed to step down. His decision was the result of his force\\'s helplessness when riots broke out after the four officers who beat Rodney King were acquitted. Gates\\'s departure is overdue. Six m nths after the Christopher Commission reported that a significant minority of the Los Angeles police force \"repetitively misuse force,\" of the 44 officers identified as the object of six or more brutality complaints, two had been fired, three had resigned and 11 removed from field duty. 28 remained untouched.\\nIntroduction:\\nLOS ANGELES Police Chief Daryl Gates had been accused of nurturing one of\\nthe most brutal police forces in the country: now he is under attack for\\nfuelling the violence and then standing by as it rolled across poor black\\nneighbourhoods.\\nMr Gates acknowledged yesterday that his department had been overwhelmed by\\nthe scale of the violence. Police could only look on, outnumbered, as crowds\\nlooted shops, and moved in mostly to protect firefighters from attack.\\nThe controversial police chief was said to have argued on Wednesday, the\\nfirst night of rioting, against sending in National Guard troops, and only\\nto have bowed later to evidence that his police force was incapable of\\nhandling the violence.\\nThat the Los Angeles police department should have been overwhelmed by the\\nriots may be understandable, but it represents one final blot on Mr Gates\\'s\\nreputation.\\nIn his 14 years of office, his critics say he has built a heavily\\npoliticised force in his own image: aggressive, insensitive and widely\\ntinged with racism.\\nShortly after his appointment in 1978, Mr Gates told a Hispanic audience\\nthat Hispanic officers were not promoted because they were lazy, and he\\nlater suggested that the carotid choke hold - a police technique severely\\ncurbed in 1983 after police had killed 16 suspects with it - might be more\\ndangerous for blacks because their arteries did not open up as fast as on\\n\\'normal people\\'.\\nIn March, Mr Gates strongly defended the detective who had led an\\ninvestigation 17 years earlier into the killing of an off-duty Los Angeles\\npolice officer, although a judge had just released the two men wrongfully\\nconvicted, calling police conduct \\'reprehensible\\' and urging an immediate\\ninvestigation of the \\'sordid record\\'.\\nThe detective involved now heads the unit which investigates shootings\\ninvolving police officers.\\nBut the Los Angeles police chief has almost complete protection from removal\\nunder a 1937 statute that followed a series of political scandals, and Mr\\nGates has developed political clout on top of this job security.\\nPresident George Bush last year called Mr Gates \\'an exemplary police chief,\\'\\nalthough at the time he called the conduct of the four Los Angeles officers\\n -whose acquittal this week over the beating of a black motorist triggered\\nthis week\\'s protests and violence - \\'sickening\\' and \\'outrageous\\'.\\nA high-ranking commission appointed after the beating, under the\\nchairmanship of Mr Warren Christopher, a lawyer and former deputy secretary\\nof state, concluded that the Los Angeles police department got results, in\\nterms of arrests, but had developed a \\'siege mentality that alienates the\\nofficer from the community\\'.\\nBesides recommending that Mr Gates should go, the Christopher commission\\nurged a policy of community policing with more foot patrols, as well as\\nmeasures to discipline racist police officers and to improve the\\ninvestigation of complaints about police brutality.\\nThe commission found that a significant minority of the Los Angeles police\\nforce \\'repetitively misuse force\\' without being properly disciplined.\\nSix months after its initial report, however, the commission noted that of\\nthe 44 officers identified as the object of six or more brutality\\ncomplaints, two had been fired, three had resigned and 11 removed from field\\nduty.\\nMr Gates has finally agreed to step down in June. His replacement, Mr Willie\\nWilliams, will be the first black head of the Los Angeles force.\\nMr Williams faces an uphill struggle, but he has drawn widespread praise as\\nPhiladelphia\\'s police commissioner since 1988 for mending fences between the\\npolice and the community - notably through the use of the foot patrol\\nmethods recommended by the Christopher commission.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Senate voted to force the Census Bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment. The Census Bureau is planning to count all residents in the nation and estimates that it counted about 2 million illegal immigrants in the 1980 Census. That gave California and New York one extra seat each. Hispanic organizations are worried about the congressional campaign. They fear that it will make it more difficult for the Census Bureau to get an accurate count in areas where some Hispanics and blacks already appear to be reluctant to provide information. The 106 million census forms could be reprinted but wording a question so those illegal immigrants answer accurately would be a challenge.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nThough the forms for the 1990 census are already at the printers, Congress is contemplating adding a question: Are you an illegal immigrant? \\n\\n\\nThe Census Bureau, as it has in the past, is planning to count all residents of the nation regardless of legal status. \\nBut the Senate already has voted to force the Census Bureau to exclude illegal immigrants in preparing tallies for congressional reapportionment. \\nA majority of the members of the House of Representatives has signaled support. \\n\\n\\n\"It is wrong to apportion congressional seats by counting people who would be deported if our immigration laws were enforced,\" Rep. Thomas Petri (R., Wis.) said in a recent House debate. \\n\\n\\nReplied Rep. Jim Kolbe (R., Ariz.): \"A very clear reading of the Constitution says that we shall count all those who are present.\" \\n\\n\\nAlthough the debate is often couched in constitutional arguments, it\\'s largely driven by geography. \\nWisconsin has few illegal immigrants; Arizona has lots. \\n\\n\\n\"It boils down to regional politics,\" says Arturo Vargas, census-program director for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of several Hispanic organizations lobbying in favor of counting illegal immigrants. \\n\\n\\nCounting illegal immigrants in 1990 is likely to mean one less seat in the House for Pennsylvania and one more for California, according to the private Population Reference Bureau. \\nThe Census Bureau\\'s chief antagonist in the Senate, Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), says seats for Connecticut, Michigan, North Carolina and Alabama also are at risk. \\nOn the other hand, Texas, Florida and New York could benefit. \\n\\n\\n\"Illegal aliens are actually taking representation away from Americans,\" says David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \\n\\n\\nThe Census Bureau, based on comparisons of its data with figures kept by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, estimates that it counted about two million illegal immigrants in 1980, half of them in California. \\nThat meant one extra seat in the House for California and New York and one less seat for Indiana and Georgia. \\n\\n\\n\"You end up diluting the vote when you start including illegals,\" says Rep. Thomas Ridge (R., Pa.), who leads the charge against the practice in the House. \\n\\n\\nOrganizations that represent Hispanics are particularly worried about the congressional campaign. \\nThey fear that any attempt to ascertain the legal status of respondents will exacerbate difficulties the Census Bureau already faces in accurately counting Hispanics and blacks. \\n\\n\\n\"As it is, the Census Bureau has a tremendous challenge in trying to convince everybody that the census is confidential,\" Mr. Vargas says. \\n\"If the Census Bureau attempts to ask people their immigration status, that\\'s going to be even harder.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Census Bureau agrees. \\n\"We tell people: Put your name down on the census form. \\nWe won\\'t report you to the housing authority {if there are too many occupants},\" says Peter Bonpanne, an assistant director. \\n\"If they see a lot of questions on there about somebody\\'s legal status, that could hurt all kinds of people\\'s participation.\" \\n\\n\\nAlthough the 106 million census forms can be reprinted if Congress acts soon, wording a question so that illegal immigrants answer accurately is a challenge, Mr. Bonpanne says. \\nThe bureau already plans to ask one in six respondents if they are citizens. \\nTo satisfy congressional critics, it would have to ask everyone that question, and then ask the legal status of anyone who isn\\'t a citizen. \\n\\n\\nRep. Ridge dismisses the practical problems. \\n\"We\\'re spending billions on the census, and the only thing we get is a bunch of belly-aching about how difficult it will be,\" he complains. \\n\"The primary purpose of the census is to distribute political power . . . not to gather demographic information.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Senate, by a vote of 58-41, added a provision to a pending immigration bill to require the government to subtract illegal immigrants when it comes up with figures used for reapportionment. \\n\\n\\nBecause California, Texas and other populous states that benefit from counting the illegal immigrants have such large delegations in the House, the House has always presented a bigger obstacle to the opponents of counting such immigrants. \\nThe House did open the door to an amendment to a spending bill that would have barred census takers from \"knowingly\" counting any illegal immigrants, but the provision was quickly sidetracked on procedural grounds. \\n\\n\\nAll sides in the debate predict a lawsuit no matter what Congress does. \\nIn 1980, a federal appeals court upheld a lower-court decision throwing out a suit that sought to bar the government from counting illegal immigrants. \\nA similar suit was dismissed this year when a federal district judge in Pittsburgh ruled that the states that sued -- Pennsylvania, Kansas and Alabama -- couldn\\'t show they had been harmed. \\n\\n\\nThe Constitution simply calls for apportioning the House on the basis of the \"the whole number of persons\" in each state. \\nThe Constitution originally called for counting \"free persons\" and indentured servants, and for counting slaves as three-fifths of a person. \\nThat was changed with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868. \\nOnly \"Indians not taxed\" were excluded, but no one has fallen into that category since 1940. \\n\\n\\nMuch of the argument in Congress turns on the use of the word \"person\" in references to the census. \\nElsewhere in the Constitution, the framers used the word \"citizen.\" \\nThey wrote, for instance, that only those who have been \"seven years a citizen of the United States\" can serve in the House. \\nThe word \"person\" was repeated in the 14th Amendment, which was drafted after the Civil War. \\n\\n\\nThose in Congress and at the Census Bureau who favor continuing the practice of counting all residents of the U.S. conclude that this language unambiguously resolves the debate. \\nTheir opponents say the drafters of the Constitution and the 14th Amendment never even considered the concept of an \"illegal immigrant,\" let alone contemplated their current numbers. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, presidential candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in March 1994 in Tijuana, Baja California prompted expressions of sympathy from neighboring countries.

The British public shows little enthusiasm for the Chunnel, fearing it will import rabies, terrorists and invading armies. The French are forging ahead with a high-speed rail link, enthusiastic because the tunnel surfaces in one of their more depressed areas. Rural southeast English are reluctant to have high-speed trains screaming through their back yards.\\nIntroduction:\\n   It\\'s been described as the largest current civil\\nengineering project, a multibillion dollar link that will help\\nrevolutionize Europe\\'s economy and physically end Britain\\'s\\nhistoric isolation, a dream born in Napoleon\\'s day.\\n   The ``Chunnel\\'\\' between Britain and France is half-dug and\\nscheduled to open on time in three years. But the three-tunnel\\nthoroughfare under the English Channel is almost 60 percent over\\nbudget, embroiled in a contractor dispute and scrambling for more\\ninvestment money.\\n   The project also has raised increasing hostility among many\\nBritons, who fear it will provide an easy conduit for ills from the\\ncontinent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.\\n   ``We will have the money to finish the project,\\'\\' says Alastair\\nMorton, British deputy chairman of Eurotunnel, the privately owned\\nAnglo-French company overseeing the work.\\n   The Chunnel\\'s June 15, 1993 scheduled debut will come six months\\nafter the 12-nation European Community formally drops remaining\\ntrade barriers and becomes a unified marketplace of 320 million\\nconsumers.

The British resisted an undersea bond\\nwith the continent envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a French\\nengineer named Albert Mathieu. Napoleon wanted to build it but\\nBritain warned him off.

As of mid-June, workers had dug 53.2\\nof the total 91.9 miles.\\n   Chunnel trains will carry passengers, cars and freight between\\nLondon and Paris in about three hours, roughly the same time as a\\nflight including ground travel, and at least twice as fast as a\\ncar-ferry journey.\\n   Eurotunnel estimates that 28 million passengers and 17 percent\\nof Britain\\'s non-oil trade will pass through the tunnel in the\\nfirst year. The Civil Aviation Authority says the tunnel should\\ndivert 5 million out of 53 million air passengers annually.\\n   This past Wednesday, shareholders approved a sale of an extra\\n$906 million worth of stock to existing shareholders, who already\\nhave bought $1.7 billion worth. That step could clear the way for a\\nbank syndicate\\'s approval of additional credit Eurotunnel has\\nrequested, from $8.6 billion to $12 billion.\\n   Assuming banks approve, the project would have a total of about\\n$14.6 billion in debt and equity financing.

Gun control measures are not effective and do not reduce crime. b. Gun availability to the public reduces the likelihood of crime. c. The lack of serious gun control legislation is due to the voting pressure and resources of the pro-gun lobby. d. The issue is not the control of firearms but rather the breakdown of social institutions. e. The thrust of the Second Amendment is its protection against tyranny f.

Forty- seven workers in the building, and 27 of them contacted tuberculosis, but many of the 27 did not work in close proximity to the infected carrier. New office buildings, built with an eye to lower heating and cooling costs, are sleek and airtight. Stale air is recirculated with not enough intake of fresh air, and such can be a factor in the spread of tuberculosis. Poor ventilation is often present in homeless shelter, prisons and hospitals.\\nIntroduction:\\nA CEO sneezes in his corporate suite. At the other end of the building, half\\nan hour later, a janitor pauses in his work and yawns.\\nThe next day, the\\njanitor is sick with the same flu the CEO had.  \\n\\nWhat\\'s the link? A poor ventilation system that does little more than\\nrecycle old, stale air from one end of the building to another.\\nMillions of\\nAmerican office workers are getting more than they bargained for when they\\ninhale in a building that has no fresh air. Along with oxygen, they may be\\ngetting flu and other infectious bugs from their co-workers.\\nThat\\'s\\nbecause, in today\\'s modern office buildings, recirculated air can mean\\nrecycled flu and other airborne infections. The evidence comes from various\\nstudies of tuberculosis, measles and flu that spread in a manner that can only\\nbe explained by poor air ventilation.\\n\"Modern office buildings are tight,\"\\nsays Jon Rosenberg, public health officer in California\\'s occupational health\\nprogram. \"In order to conserve energy, they\\'re often sealed.\"\\nExperts say\\nthe problem is not the same as \"sick building syndrome\" -- a situation in\\nwhich workers are exposed chronically to toxic chemicals and gases emitted\\nfrom carpets, furniture and other building materials. Nor is it to blame for\\nlast month\\'s outbreak in Richmond of Legionnaire\\'s disease -- an illness\\ncaused by a bug linked to wet, damp spaces rather than poor ventilation.\\nBut as in \"sick building syndrome,\" it\\'s the airtight environment that sets\\nthe stage for problems. Lack of windows is not necessarily the culprit. \"If it\\nhas a good ventilation system . . . you don\\'t necessarily have to have a sick\\nbuilding,\" Rosenberg says.\\nBut, alas, many modern ventilation systems\\nrecirculate indoor air with little or no fresh air. So the infectious bugs\\nthat a worker exhales at one end of the building can end up, via the\\nventilation system, being inhaled at the other end.\\n\"The building is not\\nthe source. People are the source,\" says Dr. Edward Nardell, who studies\\nairborne infections for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. \"Very\\nbad ventilation makes the system worse.\"\\nIn a study published in the August\\nissue of the American Review of Respiratory Diseases, Nardell and colleagues\\nat Harvard Medical School found that an outbreak of tuberculosis documented in\\none unidentified government building could have been cut in half had the\\nventilation been better.\\nThe study found that 40 percent of the building\\'s\\nworkers -- or 27 of 47 -- were infected with tuberculosis from one 30-year-old\\nsick employee. The infection rate was as high in some distant parts of the\\nbuilding as it was next to the sick employee.\\n\"By recirculating the air,\\nyou spread it throughout the building,\" says Nardell. \"People who had no\\ndirect contact with this case, might have been exposed in far reaches of the\\nbuilding.\"\\nIf tuberculosis can spread in poorly ventilated buildings, so\\ncan other infectious bugs. Respiratory infection experts say that flu viruses\\nand measles are easier to spread than TB.\\n\"This particular study deals only\\nwith TB,\" says Dr. Jonathan Samet, a respiratory-disease expert at the\\nUniversity of New Mexico, \"but the observations may apply to other organisms,\\nsuch as the respiratory viruses that cause flu.\"\\nBuilding workers had\\ncomplained for years about poor air quality.\\nThe building\\'s ventilation\\nsystem permitted circulation of some outdoor air -- 15 cubic feet per minute\\n-- a low level commonly found in buildings since the 1930s. Even lower levels\\nof outdoor air ventilation, below 10 cfm, have become common since 1973, the\\npost-oil embargo era.\\nIn the study, Nardell estimated that if outdoor air\\nventilation in the government building had been doubled -- to about 35 cubic\\nfeet per minute, a level that Massachusetts recommends for buildings where\\nsmoking is permitted -- only half as many workers would have been infected\\nwith tuberculosis.\\nOther studies have documented:;   (check) Flu spreads\\nquickly on airplanes where ventilation systems consist entirely of\\nrecirculated air.\\n(check) Measles are transmitted by infectious air in a\\npediatrician\\'s waiting room.\\n(check) Tuberculosis can spread in homeless\\nshelters, prisons and hospitals where ventilation is poor.\\nFlu spreads much\\nmore easily than TB. \"It may survive several hours in dry air,\" says Vernon\\nKnight, a respiratory virus disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine in\\nHouston. \"In those tight buildings, they continue to recirculate it, and they\\nprobably build up.\"\\nNardell and others recognize that the solution to this\\nproblem -- fixing or replacing ventilation systems to include more fresh air\\n-- can be expensive. Flu and colds will probably never be eliminated from the\\nworkplace entirely, and it may not make sense to install a new ventilation\\nsystem unless the air quality is very low.\\nIn his tuberculosis study, he\\nfound that the biggest benefit comes from improving the worst ventilation\\nsystems that allow very little fresh air.

Most vulnerable in the 1990 season are the chaparral-covered foothills and mountain canyon slopes beside densely developed residential districts of Los Angeles and its suburbs. The area\\'s average rainfall is 14.93 inches. Only 6.15 inches have fallen this year. The dead and drying brush forms a highly volatile fuel source. Residents should clear tall grass, brush, trash, and firewood at least 30 feet from any building.\\nIntroduction:\\nProlonged drought, bark beetles and a rare fungus are drying out and killing \\nbrush and trees that surround many Southern California neighborhoods, creating \\nthe potential for one of the worst wildfire seasons in decades, fire officials \\nwarned Monday. \\n\\nA map released Monday by the Los Angeles County Fire Department showed that \\nsome of the most vulnerable fire zones can be found this summer in \\nchaparral-covered foothill and mountain-canyon slopes beside densely developed \\nresidential districts of Los Angeles and its suburbs. \\n\\nThe map was released as the state Department of Forestry officially opened the \\nregion\\'s 1990 fire season, which means its firefighting crews have been placed \\non higher alert and various fire prevention regulations are now in effect. \\n\\nWhile the fire-season announcement came only two to three weeks earlier than \\nusual in the vulnerable foothills, it was a full two months ahead of schedule \\nin the heavily wooded mountain terrain of Southern California\\'s national \\nforests. \\n\\n\"The last really good rainfall was back in \\'82-83, so our brush really hasn\\'t \\nrecuperated in seven years,\" said Gordon Rowley, a fire management specialist \\nwith the U.S. Forest Service. \"Unless we get a hurricane or something -- and \\nthat\\'s not very likely -- we\\'re going to have a very bad year.\" \\n\\nRowley said other Western states also are experiencing drought, \"which means \\nthey won\\'t be able to send us the firefighting forces they normally can deploy \\nout here. . . . It doesn\\'t look good.\" \\n\\nLos Angeles, which has an annual average of 14.93 inches of rainfall, has \\nreceived 6.18 inches so far this season, promising to make this the driest \\nseason in 30 years. The rainfall season, which runs from July 1 to June 30, is \\nalmost over for 1989-90, and Southern California seldom gets much measurable \\nrain in late May and the month of June. \\n\\nIn 1982-83, 31.25 inches of rain fell on the city, more than twice the seasonal \\naverage. But since then, the annual rainfall here has averaged only 11.57 \\ninches. \\n\\nRowley said the long drought has weakened the vegetation in Southern \\nCalifornia, making it more vulnerable to disease and infestation by pests. \\n\\nHe said that with normal rainfall, pine trees are vigorous enough to fight off \\nbark beetles, which bore into trunks and limbs to lay their eggs. He said \\nhealthy trees repel the insects with a flow of pitch that suffocates them and \\nforces them out of the bark. \\n\\nBut during the current dry spell, the trees haven\\'t been able to produce enough \\nsap to rid themselves of the beetles. Rowley said the insects have \\nproliferated, killing vast stands of pines and leaving tinder-dry fuel for \\nfires. The problem is acute in the Cleveland and San Bernardino national \\nforests. \\n\\nIn foothill districts closer to Los Angeles, a fungus that preys upon \\ndrought-weakened brush has killed as much as 60% of the chaparral in some \\nportions of the Santa Monica and San Gabriel mountains. \\n\\nThe fungus, first observed about eight years ago, attacks broad-leafed plants \\nsuch as mountain lilac, manzanita and sumac, some of the more fire-resistant \\nspecies of brush. Officials said large patches of this dead and dying brush now \\nmottle the hillsides, ready to burst into flame at the slightest spark. \\n\\nAnd because of the drought, even the live brush is more incendiary than usual, \\nofficials said. \\n\\nCapt. Scott Franklin, a vegetation management officer with the county Fire \\nDepartment, said the dead trees and dry brush combine to form a fuel source so \\nvolatile that \"any ignition now could become a major fire.\" \\n\\nFire officials generally have responded to the threat with increased training \\nand requests for federal money to pay for extra firefighting personnel. \\n\\nEach densely thicketed acre of hillside chaparral contains about 60 tons of \\nbrush, he said, and that 60 tons has about the same fuel energy as 3,750 \\ngallons of gasoline. \\n\\n\"Then, if you put 80 m.p.h. winds -- the kind of Santa Anas we get in September \\n-- behind all that, a fire can consume 100 acres a minute and keep right on \\ngoing,\" Franklin said. \"You\\'re talking an energy release equivalent to several \\nnuclear events, the energy of a number of Hiroshimas.\" \\n\\nThe county Fire Department map shows that the most threatened residential areas \\ninclude a number of hillside and canyon communities within the city of Los \\nAngeles, including parts of Baldwin Hills, Hollywood, the Los Feliz district, \\nTarzana, Encino, Sherman Oaks, Sunland and Sylmar. \\n\\nEspecially threatened suburban communities include portions of Rolling Hills, \\nRancho Palos Verdes, Beverly Hills, Glendale, Pasadena, Altadena, Arcadia, \\nMonrovia, Bradbury, Duarte, Azusa, Glendora, Claremont and Whittier. \\n\\nDoug Allen, a fire prevention officer with the state Division of Forestry, said \\nresidents should clear tall grass, brush, trash, firewood and other \\ncombustibles at least 30 feet from any building. \\n\\n\\nFIRE STRESS AREAS \\n\\n Map shows largely undeveloped land where dead brush and a lack of leaf \\nmoisture in live brush create high fire hazards. Fire officials say these are \\nareas where blazes can start and expand rapidly, spreading from open land to \\nhomes and other structures. \\n\\nWhat You Can Do \\n\\n Fire officials have a number of recommendations for residents of areas where \\nthe wildfire danger is high: \\n\\nClear brush and grass a minimum of 30 feet away from any buildings. \\n\\nDo not not store firewood, trash or other combustibles within 30 feet of any \\nbuilding. \\n\\nDo not smoke, barbecue or build a campfire outdoors until the rainy season \\nresumes in the fall. \\n\\nDo not drive motor vehicles in off-road areas where brush and grass grow. \\nExhaust sparks and hot mufflers start many wildfires. \\n\\nDo not use an indoor fireplace that is not equipped with a spark-arresting \\ndevice. \\n\\nIn case of fire, turn off all tap water unless instructed otherwise. \\nIndiscriminate use of water can lower the pressure to those who need it to \\nfight the blaze. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nHeavy rains in California have worsened the threat of forest fires this summer because they stimulate the growth of grasses which then turn paper dry, helping to spread fires through trees and brush weakened by five years of drought and by invasive insects. The area at risk is about a third of the US mainland, but the threat is most extreme in California. The severity of the threat and a lack of equipment has prompted an aggressive program by authorities: putting out the smallest wildfires before they spread, deploying firefighters to where lightning storms are forecast, and clearing areas by setting controlled fires.\\nIntroduction:\\nForesters say the heavy rains that have pelted California in the past two\\nweeks have worsened the threat of fierce forest fires this summer because they\\nwill stimulate the growth of grasses.\\nThe grasses will turn paper-dry by\\nJuly, helping to spread fires quickly through trees and brush killed and\\nweakened by five consecutive years of drought and by insects, which more\\neasily invade dry wood than moist.  \\n\\nAs of last month, live pines in the Mount Palomar area near San Diego had\\nless moisture than boards at a lumber yard.\\nFirefighting also will be made\\ntougher this year because much of the military reserve and National Guard\\nequipment and pilots normally mobilized against wildfires are still in the\\nPersian Gulf and probably will be there several more months.\\nThe area at\\nrisk of severe fires spreads beyond California and takes in about a third of\\nthe United States mainland, including Oregon and Washington east of the\\nCascades and much of Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana\\nand the Dakotas.\\nBut the threat is most extreme in California, where the\\nDecember freeze added to the accumulation of dead vegetation, or fuel, as\\nfirefighters call it.\\nWhile reluctant to predict fires because they depend\\nnot just on drought but also on temperature and wind patterns, fire officials\\nare deeply worried.\\n\"This year is shaping up to be the worst fire season\\nwe\\'ve ever experienced,\" said Warner McGrew, assistant fire chief at Santa\\nBarbara, where the drought is worst and where brush fires destroyed 600 homes\\nand did $200 million damage last year.\\nThe freeze killed the avocado and\\nlemon orchards that used to serve as fire breaks, and McGrew said fire codes\\nare being strictly enforced to compel homeowners to remove vegetation near\\nhouses.\\nGiven the severity of the threat and lack of equipment and water\\nto fight fires, officials throughout the region say they plan an unusually\\naggressive approach this spring, trying to put out even the smallest wildfires\\nbefore they spread, and taking preventive measures such as deploying\\nfirefighters to an area where lightning storms are forecast.\\nIt worked in\\nOregon\\nThat approach helped last year in the Umatilla National Forest in\\nnortheastern Oregon, where 170 fires were reported, said Gordon Reinhart, a\\nfire and recreation officer with the U.S. Forest Service in Pendleton, Ore.\\n One reason the fire threat is so grave in California is population growth,\\nwhich has spread suburban development into wilderness areas such as the\\ncanyons east of Malibu Beach, 25 miles from central Los Angeles, where\\nmillion-dollar homes sit on brushy hillsides covered with highly flammable\\ngreasewood.\\nFire corridor\\nFire officials consider the Malibu canyons a\\nnatural fire corridor because high winds whip through them to the ocean.\\n\"We are going to have quite a time trying to protect those structures,\" said\\nPaul H. Rippens, assistant chief for forestry at the Los Angeles County Fire\\nDepartment.\\nThe department is clearing some areas by setting small fires\\nthat are tightly controlled, the first of which recently burned off 335\\nhillside acres in the Monte Nido area of Malibu.\\nExpand youth corps\\nGov.\\nPete Wilson has proposed expanding the state\\'s youth conservation corps to\\nreplace the troops who traditionally have stepped in to help fight the worst\\nWestern fires.\\nBut it will be difficult to replace the C-130 planes that\\nare converted into air tankers to drop retardants onto flames, and the\\nmilitary helicopters with infrared sensing devices that peer through smoke.  \\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Clinton administration has given approval for pilot welfare plans in Wisconsin and Georgia. The Wisconsin plan cuts off cash payments after two years but continues food stamps and health care.

Madison wrote that members of Congress in long-standing could become masters of the public business. Not the Federalists, but the out-of-power opposition wanted limits.

But is it true, as Mr. Crovitz\\nimplies, that Hamilton would have approved of limiting terms?\\n\\nClearly not. Federalists Hamilton and James Madison had\\nsome experience with term limits. The failed Articles of\\nConfederation included them. In fact, such limits kept\\nMadison out of legislative service at a critical time in the\\nnation\\'s history.\\n\\nFor that reason and others, the Constitutional Convention\\nunanimously rejected term limits and the First Congress\\nsoundly defeated two subsequent term-limit proposals.\\n\\nHamilton, who did not even support term limitations on the\\npresidency, reasoned that imposing limits \"would be a\\ndiminution of the inducements to good behavior.\" Madison said\\nthat some members of Congress will \"by frequent re-elections,\\nbecome members of long-standing; will be thoroughly masters\\nof the public business.\"\\n\\nIn fact, that has been the case. Over the years, term\\nlimits would have unseated Daniel Webster and Henry Clay 10\\nyears before they forged the 1850 Compromise that held the\\nUnion together. Term limits would have cost us Everett\\nDirksen, who rallied Republicans around early civil-rights\\nbills and Florida\\'s own Claude Pepper, who long defended\\nSocial Security and Medicare against revenue raids.\\n\\nIt was not the Federalists but their adversaries who\\nclamored for term limits, perhaps because they were then out\\nof power. Robert Livingston said it best at the New York\\nconvention to ratify the Constitution: \"The people are the\\nbest judges who ought to represent them. To dictate and\\ncontrol them, to tell them who they shall not elect, is to\\nabridge their natural rights.\"\\n\\nT.K.

The pilot had radioed that the right engine was on fire, then called again to say that he had shut the engine down and was coming in for a landing. Actually the left engine had burned and the pilot had shut down the wrong engine. The crash killed 49 people and injured 82. The pilot, seriously hurt, was being questioned by investigators. Authorities are ordering checks on similar engines on other aircraft, including the possibility of crossed wires on warning systems.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Authorities questioned the badly injured pilot of a\\ncrashed Boeing 737 Wednesday, but revealed no clues as to why the\\njet\\'s undamaged right engine was shut down well before the crash\\nwhile the other engine burned.\\n   The Civil Aviation Authority, meanwhile, ordered increased\\ninspections on 37 airplanes with CFM56 engines, the type on the\\nMidland Airways jet that crashed Sunday. Investigators said much\\nmore work was needed to pinpoint the cause of the crash, which\\nkilled 44 people and injured 82.\\n   The government also ordered immediate checks of engine monitoring\\nsystems on similar aircraft to verify that they correctly indicate\\nright and left, prompting speculation that a malfunctioning alarm\\nsystem could have misled the flight crew.\\n   Freddie Yetman, technical secretary of the British Airline Pilots\\nAssociation, said this showed that investigators ``must have some\\nsuspicion of these circuits.\\'\\'\\n   In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered\\ninspections of 300 Boeing 737s for possible cross-wiring of engine\\nwarning systems.\\n   U.S. media reported that the crew of the jet shut down the wrong\\nengine, and Britain\\'s tabloid newspapers drew similar conclusions in\\nbanner headlines.\\n   ``Error on the Flight Deck,\\'\\' the Today newspaper said. ``Fatal\\nError\\'\\' said the Daily Star. ``Pilot Shut Off the Wrong Engine\\'\\'\\nsaid the Sun.\\n   The Transport Department said that ``evidence obtained early in\\nthe investigation\\'\\' indicated both of the plane\\'s engines ``might\\nhave suffered a related failure\\'\\' and that possibility was still\\nbeing examined.\\n   The statement from the department\\'s Air Accidents Investigation\\nBranch also confirmed that the airplane\\'s left engine caught fire\\nand the right engine was shut down, and that pilot Kevin Hunt had\\ntold ground control the fire was in the right engine.\\n   The reasons for shutting down the engine ``are not yet clear and\\nare still under investigation,\\'\\' it said.\\n   The jet, en route from London to Belfast with 126 people aboard,\\nplunged into an embankment a half-mile short of the runway at East\\nMidlands Airport in central England as it was trying to make an\\nemergency landing Sunday night.\\n   Hunt, whose back and legs were broken in the crash, was\\ninterviewed for 45 minutes at the intensive care unit of Leicester\\nRoyal Infirmary, said the hospital\\'s deputy general manager Carol\\nHenshall.\\n   Mrs. Henshall said some of the ``wilder headlines\\'\\' had been kept\\nfrom Hunt, but friends and colleagues had told him of the news\\nreports.\\n   In the United States, NBC News quoted unidentified U.S.\\ngovernment sources as saying ``the plane\\'s flight recorders, which\\nmonitor engine performance and the pilots\\' conversations, indicate\\nthe crew shut down the wrong engine. The trouble was in one _ they\\nshut down the other.\\'\\'\\n   But the network said investigators had yet to detemine whether\\nfaulty instruments contributed to the crash.\\n   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified accident investigators,\\nsaid the crew believed they were making a routine, one-engine\\nemergency landing, and apparently thought they had solved the\\nproblem when they shut down an engine.\\n   Spokesmen for both the FAA and the National Transportation Board\\nsaid they knew of no information reaching U.S. officials about the\\nflight recorders\\' contents.\\n   The airplane\\'s two ``black boxes,\\'\\' the cockpit voice recorder\\nand digital flight data recorder, are being examined at the\\ngovernment\\'s laboratory in Farnborough, outside London.\\n   According to court documents and federal officials in America,\\nthe FBI is investigating a General Electric Co. admission that test\\nrecords may have been falsified at a factory which made parts for\\nthe CFM56 engine that failed here.\\n   The Seattle factory also made a check and flow valve for the F404\\nengine aboard the Navy\\'s FA-18 fighter, GE spokesman Richard Kennedy\\nsaid Wednesday. A letter from a GE attorney last year said test\\nrecords may have been falsified for the fighter plane valves.\\n   The timer valve made by GE for the CFM56 engine could not have\\ncaused the turbine to fail even if the valve malfunctioned, Kennedy\\nsaid.\\n   The plane took off at 7:52 p.m. Sunday. Government sources,\\nspeaking on condition of anonymity, said Hunt reported at 8:06 p.m.\\nthat ``I have an engine on fire.\\'\\' Then, at 8:14 p.m., the sources\\nsaid he told traffic control: ``I am shutting down the starboard\\n(right) engine.\\'\\'\\n   The plane crashed 12 minutes later at 8:26 p.m.\\n   The Civil Aviation Authority said that on the advice of\\ninvestigators, it was issuing new instructions for the inspection\\nand monitoring of Boeing 737-300, Boeing 737-400 and Airbus A320\\nairplanes, all of which use the CFM56 engine.\\n   The engines are made jointly by U.S.-based GE and a French\\ncompany, SNECMA.\\n   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Craig Martin said in\\nSeattle of the FAA\\'s inspection order, ``We certainly believe it\\'s a\\nprudent measure to go out and check to make sure there\\'s nothing\\nwrong with the fleet.

Flanders, the area most likely to benefit, has suffered rapid increases in unemployment. Two main areas for development are: firstly, increasing traffic as holiday makers and freight carriers head towards the tunnel opening in Calais and, secondly, tourism. West Flanders is home to some of the best-known World War 1 battlefields and large, open green spaces. The biggest advantage is the close cooperation between national and federal authorities with French and UK counterparts.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe official opening of the Channel Tunnel later this year promises to help\\nrevitalise the north-west regions of Belgium, even though the country\\'s\\nbiggest ports will suffer a loss of traffic.\\nThe chambers of commerce in Veurne and Courtrai, along with the West\\nFlanders Regional Development Authority in Bruges, are gearing up to become\\npart of what they refer to as the \\'new European Metropolitan Area.\\'\\nThis takes in the Nord-Pas de Calais in France, Western Flanders and Hainaut\\nin Belgium, and Kent in the UK.\\nThe potential for this region is enormous. According to Mr Anthony Vande\\nCandelare, an urban planner who made a study of the influence of the Channel\\nTunnel on the west of Belgium and the North of France: \\'Overnight, the\\nBelgian coast and the North of France will become the centre of Europe.\\'\\nMr Jo Libeer, managing director of the Courtrai chamber of commerce, is\\nequally optimistic about the likely impact on the area of the tunnel.\\n\\'With the TGV and the chunnel this region, which was sort of in the corner\\nof Europe, will now be in the middle of a new developing area,\\' he says.\\nThis is no bad thing for Belgium. In its last economic survey of the\\ncountry, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the\\nBelgian economy had deteriorated \\'progressively\\' since the 1980s. \\'And over\\nthe last 10 to 12 months it has taken a distinct turn for the worse.\\'\\nFurthermore, Flanders, the area most likely to benefit from the arrival of\\nthe tunnel, has recently suffered more rapid increases in unemployment than\\nin Wallonia and the Brussels region. The unemployment rate, which in 1990\\nwas 9.5 per cent in Flanders has risen to 13 per cent.\\nThe Belgian chambers in the regions most directly affected believe there are\\ntwo main areas for development: firstly, increasing traffic through western\\nFlanders as holidaymakers and freight carriers head towards the\\ntunnel-opening in Calais; and secondly tourism. To benefit fully, however, a\\ncrucial 7km stretch of the E40 European motorway between Veurne and the\\nFrench border has yet to be completed.\\nOnce this is done it will be possible to drive from Russia to England\\nwithout leaving a motorway, says Mr Philippe Claerhout, chairman of the\\nVeurne chamber of commerce and industry. Fortunately, plans to complete the\\nstretch have been agreed and it should be open some time next year.\\nOn the downside, the Westhoek region is badly placed to benefit from rail\\ntransport.\\n\\'Even after the doubling of the tracks and electrification of the railway\\nline between Ghent and De Panne, we will still be a remote corner,\\' says Mr\\nClaerhout.\\nFurthermore, Belgium\\'s biggest ports are expecting traffic loads to fall, as\\nfreight and passengers are directed towards Calais. Worst affected will be\\nOstend and Zeebrugge, two ports hoping to hold their own by concentrating on\\nlinks with ports in the north of England.\\nNonetheless, the improved, if imperfect, transport communications of the\\nWest Flanders region are apparently paying off. Mr Geert Sanders, who works\\nfor the Regional Development Authority of West Flanders, says there is\\nalready evidence that the region\\'s enhanced communications are attracting\\nnew businesses. For example, Baronie, a Dutch chocolate company, is opening\\na new base in the southern part of West Flanders.\\nThere is, however, a danger that Belgium will not make the most of the\\ncommercial opportunities - \\'we will try to attract new industry, but our\\nregion is very small and our industrial zones are full,\\' says Mr Ludo\\nVerstraete, of the Veurne chamber of commerce. The Belgian authorities have\\ndragged their feet over decisions to dedicate new areas, he says.\\nThe other main focus for development is tourism. As Mr Claerhout says: \\'We\\nneed to convince people from other countries that it is worth their while to\\nstop in Westhoek at the time of their journey through the North of Europe to\\nEngland.\\'\\nThe potential is there. West Flanders is home to some of the best-known\\nWorld War One battlefields, and promoters of the region insist that its\\nlarge, open green spaces will, when properly developed, attract foreign\\nvisitors. But once again, there is a danger that Belgium will miss out. It\\nhas been slower to develop the tourist potential of the Channel Tunnel than\\nFrance.\\nAround Calais, a commercial and leisure centre, hotels and activity parks,\\nknown as \\'La Cite de L\\'Europe\\', are springing up while Lille is home to\\nEuralille, a similar development. As Mr Verstraete of the Veurne chamber of\\ncommerce says: \\'Tourism is very important . . . we really have to develop\\nour hotels and tourist infrastructure.\\'\\nBut the biggest advantages for Belgium will come from close co-operation\\nbetween the national and federal authorities and their French and UK\\ncounterparts. In a Europe without frontiers, this will be the most effective\\nway of benefiting from the the Channel Tunnel.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAt the opening of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season, forecasters hope for new technological help critical to growing coastal populations. The Air Force is phasing out hurricane reconnaissance flights, agreeing to only two more years. Only one satellite is now available for tracking hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been approached to take over the flights. New satellites are not expected until late 1990. Forecaster Hal Gerrish said that \"now we can see past the Antilles into the Atlantic and over toward Hawaii on the west,\" but he would like to be able to see all the way to Africa where Atlantic hurricanes develop.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Forecasters preparing for Thursday\\'s\\nopening of the Atlantic hurricane season wish they could predict\\nthe arrival of new technological help they say may be crucial to\\never-growing coastal populations.\\n   The Air Force has agreed to fly hurricane reconnaissance flights\\nfor two more years, but has made it clear it plans to phase out the\\nmissions. And only one satellite is available for tracking\\nhurricanes.\\n   ``We just have nothing right now to lean on,\\'\\' says Ken\\nMcKinnon, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Tom Lewis of North Palm Beach,\\nFla., who has introduced a bill in Congress to keep hurricane\\nhunters flying at least another five years. ``We\\'ve got one\\nsatellite and they\\'re telling us it\\'ll do the job. If it blinks,\\nhow do you track weather?\\'\\'\\n   The Air Force doesn\\'t want to be involved. ``We have in the last\\nfew years examined our need for manned weather reconnaissance and\\nfeel there\\'s no real compelling military reason,\\'\\' said spokesman\\nLt. Col. Darrell Hayes.\\n   ``We\\'re not disputing that the hurricane center and the weather\\nservice need the data. We\\'re just saying there may be more\\nappropriate agencies to provide the information,\\'\\' he said, adding\\nthat the service had approached the National Oceanic and\\nAtmospheric Administration about taking over the flights.\\n   Besides the flights, forecasters depend on radar and satellite\\ndata.\\n   The single working weather satellite wasn\\'t intended to be\\nalone. A second satellite failed, and a replacement for the failed\\ncraft was blown up in a mishap on the launch pad, forcing\\nforecasters to make do.\\n   There are new satellites on the horizon, says Bob Sheets,\\ndirector of the National Hurricane Center. But they\\'ve been due for\\na long time and aren\\'t expected before late 1990.\\n   ``It is a major concern for us,\\'\\' Sheets said.\\n   Forecasters also are worried about a shift in the pattern of\\nhurricane activity in recent years. Since 1985, Sheets said, there\\nseem to be more hurricanes and they\\'re more likely to hit the\\nUnited States.\\n   ``We may be in an upswing,\\'\\' he said, ``possibly back to the\\npattern of the \\'40s, \\'50s and \\'60s when we had a tremendous number\\nof landfall hurricanes.\\'\\'\\n   Max Mayfield, hurricane specialist at the National Weather\\nService in Miami, said experts don\\'t known enough yet about\\nhurricanes to tell if this is just a peak in activity, or a return\\nto the 50s and 60s.\\n   ``Now we can see past the Antilles out into the Atlantic, and\\nover toward Hawaii on the west,\\'\\' said forecaster Hal Gerrish.\\n``We\\'d like to be able to see all the way to Africa,\\'\\' which is\\nwhere Atlantic hurricanes develop, he said.\\n   The need for improved tracking systems is important because more\\nand more people are moving to coastal locations likely to be\\naffected by storms.\\n   ``I spoke to about 5,000 people on the west coast of Florida,\\'\\'\\nSheets said. ``Ninety-plus percent of them were from the Midwest or\\nNortheast and had just come to Florida.

The deaths resulted from a fire started when police hurled a stun grenade into the apartment of the deceased. In the hotel incident, police, responding to a complaint of a loud party, are alleged to have used the term \"nigger\" and to have beaten some of those arrested. The president of the Minneapolis Urban League says that police brutality has been a problem there for years.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Allegations of police racism and brutality\\nhave shaken this city that for decades has prided itself on a\\nprogressive attitude toward civil rights and a reputation for racial\\nharmony.\\n   The deaths of two blacks at a drug raid that went awry, followed\\n10 days later by a scuffle between police and blacks at a downtown\\nhotel, touched off an outcry by minority leaders for an outside\\nreview of the department.\\n   ``It\\'s like a watch spring.

It is the only major diamond producer currently selling total production to De Beers, who argues independent selling would compromise the cartel\\'s ability to preserve an orderly market. IDC, an independent who markets diamonds for four countries, refutes this and argues Botswana doesn\\'t know the real value of its diamonds, which represent half De Beers\\' profits. Botswana faces a budget deficit. In 1987 it sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers for $250 million and a 5.27% share.\\nIntroduction:\\nNEGOTIATIONS FOR a new contract between Botswana, the world\\'s most important\\ndiamond producer in value terms, and De Beers, the South African group which\\ncontrols 80 per cent of the market for rough (uncut) diamonds, are taking\\nmuch longer than expected. The previous three-year contract ended on\\nDecember 31.\\nSome Botswana politicians want to change De Beers\\' exclusive sales contract\\nso that part of their country\\'s output can be sold independently of the\\nSouth African group\\'s international cartel. This would give Botswana its own\\n\\'market window\\' to see what its diamonds are worth in the free market.\\nDe Beers is resisting any change. Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of the\\ngroup\\'s Central Selling Organisation, argues that if Botswana chose not to\\nsell its production exclusively through his organisation, the CSO\\'s ability\\nto regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised.\\nHe said: \\'Because the major (diamond) producers freely consent to sell\\nexclusively through one channel, the CSO is able to preserve an orderly\\nmarket by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand.\\'\\nHowever, IDC (Holdings), a London-based group which claims to be the most\\nexperienced and substantial dealer in rough diamonds independent of the CSO,\\nsuggests the CSO\\'s attitude \\'is unreasonable and based on a conceptual\\nargument with little substance in fact.\\'\\nIn presentations to Botswana\\'s Minerals Policy Committee and members of\\nparliament, IDC has been arguing that, not only was it commercially\\nessential for Botswana to understand the real value of its diamond output,\\nbut that the country had a political responsibility to do so.\\n\\'Data accumulated independently of the CSO would put Botswana in a position\\nto have more input into the arrangements for the sale of its diamonds,\\' IDC\\npointed out. \\'On a political level this would enable the government to\\nanswer its critics or its electors with confidence and sure knowledge when\\nquestioned about arrangements for the disposal of the country\\'s mineral\\nassets.\\'\\nIf Botswana were to sell 10 per cent of its rough diamond production, worth\\nabout USDollars 100m, independently of the CSO - which sells about Dollars\\n4bn-worth a year from all over the world - it would represent no threat to\\nmarket stability, IDC said.\\nIt claims analysts have estimated that 50 per cent of De Beers\\' diamond\\nprofits in 1989 came from Botswana. \\'This profit is disproportionate to the\\nsale of diamonds by Debswana (De Beers\\' subsidiary in Botswana) to the CSO\\nas a percentage of the CSO\\'s total sales profits,\\' IDC says.\\n\\'It is not unreasonable to reflect whether the fact that Botswana is the\\nonly major producer currently selling 100 per cent of its production to the\\nCSO has any bearing on the substantial profits made by the CSO on the sale\\nof its diamonds.\\'\\nOther substantial producers such as the Soviet Union, Angola, Zaire and\\nAustralia do not sell all their production to the CSO and therefore have\\naccess to independent market information.\\nIDC does have a vested interest. It already markets diamonds for producers\\nin Guinea, Guyana, Brazil and the Central African Republic, and is offering\\nto do some marketing for Botswana.\\nIt acknowledges that all sectors of the diamond trade welcomed the CSO\\'s\\nefforts to keep the diamond market stable. But \\'the fact that the CSO forms\\npart of an aggressive, profit-motivated public company with a primary\\nresponsibility to its shareholders is often lost from view.\\'\\nDe Beers says Botswana diamonds do not contribute half its diamond account\\nprofits - but it will not divulge the true figure.\\nIt suggests IDC\\'s arguments are flawed because they are based on an\\nassumption that Botswana needs more market information. However, in common\\nwith other producers selling diamonds to the CSO, Botswana has appointed\\nindependent valuers who continuously monitor diamond production and the\\nprices paid.\\nAccording to the CSO, these valuers are fully informed about market\\nconditions and the prices received for Botswana stones.\\nMr Geoffrey Leggett at IDC suggests, however, the valuer only ensures that\\nthe assortment of diamonds from Botswana conforms to an agreed sample and\\nthat the agreed contract price is paid. \\'He is not a trader, he does not\\nknow what the stones are worth in the market.\\'\\nDe Beers insists it remains on cordial terms with Botswana and says the\\ncountry is still selling its diamonds through the CSO. It is not the first\\ntime that contract negotiations have gone on past the theoretical deadline.\\nThe Botswana government recently set up a diamond cutting centre with De\\nBeers\\' technical help, and this, too, should further the country\\'s\\nunderstanding of the market.\\nThere has been a special relationship between the CSO and Botswana since\\n1987 when the country sold its diamond stockpile to De Beers in exchange for\\nan estimated USDollars 250m and a 5.27 per cent shareholding in the South\\nAfrican group.\\nAnalysts suggest market conditions do not help Botswana press its case.

US insurers expect to pay out $7.3 billion in Florida making Hurricane Andrew by far the costliest disaster the industry has ever faced. This estimate does not include any projection for claims in Louisiana, so the final cost will be higher still.\\nIntroduction:\\nUS INSURERS expect to pay out an estimated Dollars 7.3bn (Pounds 3.7bn) in\\nFlorida as a result of Hurricane Andrew - by far the costliest disaster the\\nindustry has ever faced.\\nThe figure is the first official tally of the damage resulting from the\\nhurricane, which ripped through southern Florida last week. In the battered\\nregion it is estimated that 275,000 people still have no electricity and at\\nleast 150,000 are either homeless or are living amid ruins.\\nPresident George Bush yesterday made his second visit to the region since\\nthe hurricane hit. He pledged the government would see through the clean-up\\n\\'until the job is done\\'.\\nAlthough there had already been some preliminary guesses at the level of\\ninsurance claims, yesterday\\'s figure comes from the Property Claims Services\\ndivision of the American Insurance Services Group, the property-casualty\\ninsurers\\' trade association. It follows an extensive survey of the area by\\nthe big insurance companies.\\nMr Gary Kerney, director of catastrophe services at the PCS, said the\\nindustry was expecting about 685,000 claims in Florida alone. It is reckoned\\nthe bulk of the damage - over Dollars 6bn in insured claims - is in Dade\\nCounty, a rural region to the south of Miami.\\nHowever, the final cost of Hurricane Andrew will be higher still.\\nYesterday\\'s estimate does not include any projection for claims in\\nLouisiana, which was also affected by the storm, although less severely than\\nFlorida. An estimate of the insured losses in this second state will be\\nreleased later this week.\\nBut on the Florida losses alone, Hurricane Andrew becomes the most costly\\ninsured catastrophe in the US. Hurricane Hugo, which hit the east coast in\\nSeptember 1989, cost the insurance industry about Dollars 4.2bn. The Oakland\\nfire disaster, in California last year, cost Dollars 1.2bn.\\nBy contrast, insurance claims resulting from the Los Angeles riots earlier\\nthis year - the most expensive civil disturbance in the US - totalled just\\nDollars 775m.\\nHurricane Andrew leaves the US property-casualty insurers facing their\\nworst-ever year for catastrophe losses. The LA riots and a series of\\ntornadoes, wind and hailstorms in states such as Kansas, Oklahoma and Iowa\\nhad already produced insured losses of Dollars 3.9bn. With Florida\\'s\\nHurricane Andrew losses added in, the total rises to Dollars 11.2bn.\\nThis easily exceeds the record Dollars 7.6bn of catastrophe losses seen in\\n1989, when the industry paid out on both Hurricane Hugo and the Loma Prieta\\nearthquake in California.\\nWall Street, however, has reacted calmly to the record losses expected, and\\ninsurers\\' shares - although lower initially - have been firming recently.\\nThe property-casualty industry is thought to have adequate reserves to cover\\nthe disaster.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nNelson Polsby does not believe term limits will give their proponents what they want. Term limitation will not decrease the influence of interest groups and their money because new candidates need even more money to get recognition. Inexperienced legislators must learn their job from the legislative staff, bureaucrats and lobbyists, thus shifting the power from the elected officials. We should vote poor performers out. Terms limits would only throw the good out with the bad. He also fears the main supporters of term limits are those who are assuming non-incumbents are easier to beat or buy.\\nIntroduction:\\nProposals to limit the terms of members of Congress and of state legislators \\nare popular and getting more so, according to the pundits and the polls. \\nStudents of government like me find it hard to understand why. Contrary to most \\nof the propaganda on the subject, these constitutional changes won\\'t do what \\ntheir proponents say they want to accomplish. \\n\\nFor example, term limitations will not decrease the influence of interest \\ngroups and their money on elections. Quite the contrary. Forcing senior members \\nof a legislature to retire means that the new candidates who try to take their \\nplace will have to invest heavily in achieving the name recognition that the \\nveterans already have. This will require large new infusions of money and \\nelectoral alliances with interest groups who can supply it. \\n\\nVeteran members -- proven vote-getters -- are much more powerful in relation to \\nspecial interests than candidates who have to prove themselves in an uncertain \\nand expensive campaign environment. \\n\\nTerm limitations won\\'t improve the functioning of the legislature, either. \\nPeople need time to learn their jobs. Term limitations throw away the benefits \\nof learning from experience. Inexperienced legislators are less powerful in \\nrelation to legislative staff, executive branch bureaucrats and interest-group \\nlobbyists from whom they must learn the customs and routines of legislative \\noperations and the stories behind policy proposals. \\n\\nNew people in any complex institution are highly dependent on the people around \\nthem. Term limitations just shift power from elected officials to the \\nrelatively inaccessible officials, bureaucrats and influence peddlers who \\nsurround them. \\n\\nWhy do we assume that new blood is automatically better than old? Of course we \\nshould pay attention to the quality of our legislators and vote against those \\nwhose performance we find wanting. Term limits merely guarantee that the good \\nwill disappear along with the bad. \\n\\nFinally, term limitations won\\'t enhance representative democracy. Just the \\nopposite, since they create an artificial barrier preventing voters from \\nreturning to office legislators they might otherwise favor. Why are we so \\ncertain that voters have such terrible judgment that they need a constitutional \\nrestriction keeping them from voting for incumbents they know and like? It is \\nhard to see how restricting voters\\' alternatives in this arbitrary way can be \\nproposed in the name of representative government or of democracy. \\n\\nOne must conclude that other forces are at work. More likely, groups and \\ninterests that now have a hard time winning against incumbents are seeking term \\nlimitations to improve their chances of winning office. They are undoubtedly \\ncalculating that non-incumbents are easier to beat, or buy. They\\'re probably \\nright about that. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nNationwide opinion polls about the Channel tunnel show convincingly that: the English do not want a fixed link; they like ferries and their island story; they are afraid of long, dark tunnels underwater, and of rabies, rats and terrorists crawling through; not to mention European undesirables. However, the tunnel will be a symbol of European unity. Moreover, it will reinforce historically dominant trading links (London - Frankfurt - Milan), bolstering Northern Europe as an economic entity challenged by a strengthened Mediterranean \"sunbelt\". For the rest of us, it means that you can climb aboard and whiz from London to Paris in three hours.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nFolkestone, England -- \"We\\'ve been fighting the bastards\\nsince 1066\" was the taxi driver\\'s response to my\\nfaint-hearted suggestion that the Channel tunnel, one end of\\nwhich we were making our way toward, signaled a new epoch in\\nAnglo-French relations. Had he read my mind, or just the same\\nedition of the Sun, which that morning had offered the Black\\nDeath, Paris streets \"ankle deep in dog mess,\" and a\\ncomparatively high suicide rate (in France \"suicide relieves\\nthe daily grind\") among its 10 reasons to hate the French?\\n\\n\"Froggy bashing\" is nothing new here, though it does seem\\nto have gained momentum. But the English objection to the\\ntunnel is not a simple xenophobic reflex. Nationwide opinion\\npolls about this, the biggest civil-engineering project in\\nEurope this century, show convincingly that the English don\\'t\\nwant a fixed link; that they like ferries and their island\\nstory; that they are worried about the costs to the\\nenvironment and to themselves; that they are afraid of long,\\ndark tunnels underwater; and of rabies, rats and terrorists\\ncrawling through, not to mention other undesirables, say,\\nEuropeans in general. The chalk marl under the Channel may be\\nperfectly pliable; the spirit of gloom and resentment about\\nthe tunnel (though the disgruntled always are noisier than\\nthe positive or the indifferent) may prove more intractable.\\n\\nNevertheless, after at least 20 false starts since 1802,\\nthe project to join England to \"Europe\" is irreversibly under\\nway. This attempt, which began life on Feb. 12, 1986, at\\nCanterbury with the signing of the Tunnel Treaty by Margaret\\nThatcher and Francois Mitterrand (whose Rolls-Royce\\nreportedly was met with flying eggs and chants of \"Froggy,\\nFroggy, Froggy, Out, Out, Out\"), promises to be completed and\\nopen for business by June 1993.\\n\\nThe British terminal may be seen, or at least imagined,\\nbelow a ledge of dewy grass near Dover, dotted with poppies\\nand daisies, with church spires in one direction and the\\nwhite cliffs in another. Slow tractors are piling up walls of\\nearth, cranes and pulleys hoist slabs of cast concrete\\nthrough a jungle of rusting iron armatures. It looks like\\nchild\\'s play, until you spot the men in hard hats: tiny\\nbeside their mechanical dinosaurs, they are the toys in the\\nsandbox.\\n\\nLater, I get close to the toy chest, the construction camp\\nin the shadow of Shakespeare Cliff, where nearly 1,000 of\\nthem live. \"Farthingloe Village -- a new concept in community\\nliving\" -- consists of 42 featureless blocks, spike-topped\\nfencing, floodlights, security guards and warnings that \"All\\npersonnel may be searched on leaving the premises\"; residents\\npay #45, or $80, a week. But the men staying here -- most of\\nthem migrant laborers from Ireland and northern England --\\nare rumored to earn as much as $1,750 a week.\\n\\nInside the tunnel it is cold and wet and dark, but mainly\\nit\\'s big. We few journalists, looking weedy as hell clutching\\nour notebooks, trudge along in borrowed boots on a guided\\ntour past some very large men (inwardly I take back all I\\nthought, from the safety of the dewy green, poppy-sprayed\\nledge, about \"toys\"). The site manager gives us the big\\nfigures. The total length of each tunnel will be 32 miles, 25\\nof which will be under the sea. Seven thousand British and\\n4,000 French workers, on eight- to 12-hour shifts, have\\ncompleted more than half of the job. Of the three tunnels --\\ntwo big ones for trains and another for service -- the\\nsmallest is the most advanced: They\\'ve bored more than 27\\nmiles. The breakthrough is expected by November.\\n\\nThe boring machines are fantastic: guided by satellite,\\ngyroscope, computer and laser, these monsters, equipped with\\nCuisinart-style blades more than 16 feet wide, can chop and\\nshred chalk at about 15 feet an hour, or 650-1,000 feet a\\nweek. We only hear of other machines, such as a giant pump in\\na 230-foot shaft that sucks the spoil slurry out of the\\ntunnel, but we get some more big figures for the notebooks:\\nTwo thousand tons of spoil come out every hour; 500 tons of\\nmaterial go in; money, the press here reports, is being spent\\nat a rate of $4.4 million a day.\\n\\nThe 1986 treaty, which contains a clause prohibiting\\ngovernment subsidies for the tunnel, gave a 55-year\\nconcession to Eurotunnel, an Anglo-French partnership that\\ncommissioned Trans Manche Link, a consortium of five English\\ncontractors (Costain, Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow, Balfour Beatty\\nand Tarmac) and five French (Boygues, Dumez, Societe Generale\\nd\\'Entreprise, Societe Auxiliaire d\\'Entreprises, Spie\\nBatignolles) to design and build the tunnel. The original\\nforecast for the whole project was $8.5 billion; to the\\nchagrin of the 206 banks involved, it now has reached $13.3\\nbillion and many people estimate tunnel costs of $17.5\\nbillion before we see the light at the end.\\n\\nAll this for mad dogs and Frenchmen in 1993? Not quite.\\nNineteen ninety-two may mean an end to duty-free goods, but\\nthe tunnel will be more than a symbol of European unity; it\\nwill, transport analysts say, reinforce historically dominant\\ntrading links in the London-Frankfurt-Milan so-called \"Golden\\nTriangle,\" bolstering northern Europe as an economic entity\\nat a time when its pre-eminence is being challenged by a\\nstrengthened Mediterranean \"sunbelt,\" stretching from\\nBarcelona to Trieste, and by new opportunities to the east.\\nAnd for the rest of us, it will mean that you can climb\\naboard and whiz from London to Paris in three hours. There\\nalso is, however, a missing link.\\n\\nAll leaders like to leave their monuments. For Mr.\\nMitterrand, with his pyramid and his own triumphal arch, the\\nChunnel is a new shape for the collection. For Mrs. Thatcher,\\nin her way a choreographer or a sculptor, the monument may be\\nseen in terms of negative space: The tunnel is perhaps her\\nfinal proof that Britain\\'s Victorian glory can be recaptured\\nwithout spending a penny of public money. In the same week\\nthat the French government revealed its plans to spend 190\\nbillion francs ($34 billion) on expanding its high-speed rail\\nnetwork, the prime minister announced that there will be no\\ngovernment subsidy for a fast train between London and the\\ntunnel, in effect shelving plans for a much discussed new\\n70-mile link between London and Folkestone.\\n\\nMany observers believe that, by doing nothing to improve\\nthe nation\\'s creaking rail system, Britain will lose out on\\nthe full benefits of the Chunnel. (\"Britain is about to enter\\nthe 21st-century with the worst transport infrastructure in\\nnorthern Europe,\" John Banham, the director general of the\\nConfederation of British Industry, said recently. \"We will\\nbecome the butt of French jokes and be economically\\nmarginalized in Europe.\") And travelers from France will have\\nto adjust, perhaps by chewing gum rapidly, when they switch\\nfrom the \"grande vitesse\" of the Chemins de Fer Francais to\\nthe homely milk route of British Rail, and sit out an extra\\nhalf-hour until arrival at Waterloo. This, though, is not a\\nmatter of time or money, it\\'s \"an attitude problem.\" While\\nthe number of French shareholders in the project has risen\\nfrom 210,000 to 436,000, the number of British investors has\\nremained at 100,000; and while 15,000 Kent residents marched\\non Westminster in protest against the desecration of their\\nvillages, there was keen competition among French towns to\\nhave the new fast train service run through their region.\\nDespite the gift packs of French and English wine (more\\nunfavorable comparisons) on sale just beneath the \"I dig the\\ntunnel\" stickers at the Eurotunnel Exhibition Centre, most\\nBritons seem to share, or will have to learn to live in\\nregretful memory of, Gladstone\\'s view that England should be\\n\"happy that the wise dispensation of Providence has cut her\\noff by that streak of silver sea . . . partly from dangers,\\nabsolutely from the temptations which attend upon the local\\nneighbourhood of the Continental nations.\"\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nWith a third presidential candidate assassinated, Columbia\\'s government refused to put off the 1990 election and vowed to keep up the fight against drug traffickers.

The scientists say there is no evidence that similar \\ntransmission is occurring among cows. \\n  The zoo\\'s small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes \\nclosely \\nrelated to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to \\nbovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Of eight animals born in \\nthe herd since 1987, five have contracted the disease. Only one \\nof the five could have eaten feed containing protein from sheep, \\nbelieved to be the origin of the outbreak. \\n  The kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease \\nsince it appeared in cows. It has also been found in domestic \\ncats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in \\neland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx. In the \\nUnited States, mink have been affected by it. \\n  The infective agent and its mode of transmission are \\nunknown, \\nbut the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be \\nmore easily infected than others. Sheep are believed to catch \\nthe disease by contact with placentas in fields after births, \\nbut in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely. \\n  In THE VETERINARY RECORD, the scientists eliminate most \\nroutes of infection. Infected feed cannot account for four \\ncases. Nor can at least three of the affected animals have \\ncaught the disease from their mothers, who did not suffer from \\nit. It is possible but unlikely that the mothers were carriers \\nthat passed on the infection without having symptoms themselves. \\n  If this were so, it would have important implications for \\nthe \\ndisease in cows. It is more likely, the scientists believe, that \\nan unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and \\nwas passed along, as with more mundane infections. Because of \\nthe danger to other animals, the kudu herd has been isolated. \\n  Another danger taken seriously by the zoo, a world centre \\nfor \\nbreeding rare and endangered species, is that animals bred in \\ncaptivity could carry the infection when released into the wild. \\nIf they proved as vulnerable as the kudu, this could be \\ndisastrous. \\n  The scientists say that the next step must be to examine \\nwhether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as \\nthat in cows. If it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu \\nwere simply more susceptible to the disease. If, however, it \\nturned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form, \\nthe case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger. \\n  TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1993 \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nDe Beers Consolidated Mines of South Africa, the sole middleman in a diamond cartel known as the Syndicate, controls 80% of the world\\'s uncut diamond market. It is again flourishing after near extinction in 1983, having convinced the industry it was indispensable by putting millions into diamond promotion, forcing members to rejoin by dumping diamonds, and boycotting dealers who reject offered merchandise. De Beers\\' rise dates from 1938 when it began urging couples to buy diamond engagement rings. Future challenges include nations wanting more control over distribution, cheaper diamonds on the market, and a possible US ban on South African diamond imports.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nConfounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls 80% of the world\\'s uncut-diamond market, is thriving. \\n\\n\\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is floundering, and the international tin cartel has collapsed. \\nBut De Beers not only halted a fall in rough-diamond prices, it raised them an average 14.5% last year. \\nSales still soared 40% to a near-record $2.56 billion, double the $1.26 billion posted in the 1982 doldrums. \\n\\n\\nDe Beers managed the comeback by convincing diamond producers, dealers and the jewelry industry that its marketing muscle was indispensable. \\n\"Selling diamonds is the business of dealers and jewelers; helping them to sell more is ours,\" says Stephen Lussier, a De Beers marketing executive. \\n\\n\\nDe Beers helped with an advertising and promotion budget that swelled to $110 million this year, up from $43 million in 1980. \\nSupplemented by $20 million spent by the diamond trade, the De Beers campaign helped raise world sales of diamond jewelry to 47 million pieces valued at $21.6 billion in 1985, up from 42 million pieces valued at $16 billion in 1979. \\nFigures for 1986 aren\\'t yet available, but De Beers says it was another record. \\n\\n\\nThe promotional budget covers market research, a world-wide network of as many as 200 public-relations officials, and advertising campaigns coordinated by the agencies N.W. Ayer &amp; Son in the U.S. and J. Walter Thompson Co. in 27 other countries. \\n\\n\\nThe master sales plan began in 1938, when former De Beers Chairman Harry Oppenheimer asked Ayer to woo American couples to buy expensive diamond engagement rings. \\nToday the U.S. is the world\\'s No. 1 market, with $8 billion in annual retail diamond jewelry sales, or about a 40% share, even though a 1971 antitrust law prevents De Beers from operating directly there. \\nAbout three-fourths of American women own diamond engagement rings that cost an average $1,300. \\n\\n\\nDe Beers\\'s strategy is two-pronged, says Mr. Lussier. \\nGeneral \"diamond image\" advertising aims at perpetuating the mystique of quality diamonds as \"the ultimate expression of love,\" he says. \\n\\n\\nDe Beers applied similar promotional techniques world-wide. \\nOne out of 17 Japanese couples bought engagement rings two decades ago. \\nNow two-thirds do, and Japan is the second-largest diamond jewelry market, followed by West Germany. \\n\\n\\nDe Beers\\'s Central Selling Organization, known as the Syndicate, is the pipeline between diamond mines and dealers based mainly in Antwerp, Belgium; Bombay, India; Tel Aviv, Israel, and New York. \\nAs the sole middleman, De Beers usually avoids the acrimony that has divided other cartels. \\n\\n\\nThe Syndicate has purchase contracts with De Beers\\'s own mines in South Africa and Namibia (a territory controlled by South Africa), other African states such as Botswana, Zaire and Sierra Leone, and Australia. \\n\\n\\nDe Beers offers its cache to select dealers 10 times a year at sales known as \"sights.\" \\nEach dealer gets a box containing uncut diamonds. \\nThe dealer must accept or reject the entire box, valued at between $1 million and $25 million. \\nIf the dealer refuses to buy, De Beers may never invite him back. \\n\\n\\nThis ritual has enabled De Beers to maintain price stability. \\nThe cartel hasn\\'t cut prices since it was founded more than half a century ago. \\nDespite grumbling, diamond dealers generally believe that a healthy international diamond market depends on the Syndicate. \\n\\n\\nOPEC members \"tend to do what they like,\" says Jo Flies, chief economist of the Antwerp Diamond Council. \\nBut De Beers is unique, he says, in influencing production and consumption of diamonds. \\n\"People mesmerized by the producers\\' cartels forget that De Beers is an aggressive, ruthless and effective sales organization,\" says a London dealer. \\n\\n\\nSome analysts warn, however, that De Beers\\'s future may be affected by the surge in diamond output elsewhere, notably Australia. \\nWorld diamond production has soared to 88 million carats from 47 million carats in 1982. \\nA carat equals 1/142 of an ounce. \\nAbout 20% of the prize diamonds are produced in southern Africa, but the market is being flooded by cheaper diamonds mainly from Australia and Zaire. \\n\\n\\nThe Soviet Union, which produces an estimated 12 million carats of top-grade diamonds annually, is another unknown. \\nDe Beers has a sales arrangement with the Soviets, but Moscow has dumped diamonds before and may prove difficult to keep in line. \\nAngola left the cartel last year, partly because it is involved in a bitter war with South African-backed rebels. \\nOther African nations in the cartel want more control over distribution, dealers say. \\n\\n\\n\"De Beers can\\'t stop evolution,\" says Jack Lunzer, chairman of IDC Holdings Ltd., a London-based diamond firm that sells diamonds for Guinea, an African nation that isn\\'t a cartel member. \\nWhile sales independence from De Beers \"could be disastrous\" for the market, Mr. Lunzer says, that won\\'t deter those producers who want \"more information and knowledge about final sales of their material.\" \\n\\n\\nBut the fate of De Beers, South Africa\\'s most famous company, will depend largely on developments in that troubled country, dealers say. \\nInternational sanctions, including a possible U.S. import ban on South African diamonds, pose a growing threat. \\n\\n\\nRecent history indicates, however, that it would be hasty to write off the cartel. \\nIn 1981, Zaire, which mines 22% of world diamond output, left the cartel. \\nAustralia was about to open a huge diamond mine and a speculative boom had led to widespread dealer bankruptcies. \\nThe monopoly was threatened with extinction. \\n\\n\\nWhile average prices of De Beers\\'s rough diamonds rose 37%, prices of polished diamonds in dealers\\' stocks collapsed. \\nThe top-grade investment diamond, D-Flawless, tumbled to around $8,000 a carat in 1985 from an average of $55,000 in 1980. \\n\\n\\nIn a series of shrewd moves, De Beers forced Zaire to rejoin the cartel by dumping diamonds. \\nMeanwhile, diamond demand by consumers increased, fueled by De Beers\\'s promotion campaign and favorable economic trends. \\n\\n\\nDealers say trade is buoyant again because of lower interest rates and a weak dollar that makes dollar-priced diamonds cheaper in Japan and Europe. \\nSince November 1985, prices of D-Flawless diamonds have risen 56% to around $14,000 a carat. \\n\\n\\n\"De Beers is powerful; it is everywhere,\" says Alfred Lachowsky, chairman of the Antwerp Diamond High Council. \\n\\n\\nThe cartel will continue to control world diamond markets, Mr. Lachosky says. \\n\"You can\\'t mix diamonds with oil.\" \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nAccording to Peru\\'s President Garcia, Shining Path rebels have formed the People\\'s Defense Revolutionary Movement to carry their operations into Lima and other coastal urban areas.

Swai, who ran in the 1984 Olympics for Tanzania is a recovering alcoholic. Swai began his comeback by entering the Trib10k race but finished a poor 16th. He has won two races since then, the Coronado Half Marathon and the Goodwill Games 10k run in Seattle. He was able to achieve victory in the Goodwill Games despite his taking a wrong turn. Swai believes the upcoming race will be a difficult one in that the runner who paces himself will win.\\nIntroduction:\\nAlphonce Swai, who ran in the 1984 Olympics for Tanzania, but who later fell \\nprey to alcoholism, continues his comeback bid in Sunday\\'s America\\'s Finest \\nCity HomeFed Half Marathon. \\n\\nThe race is scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. at the Cabrillo Monument atop the \\nPoint Loma Peninsula. It will wind its way to the finish line in Balboa Park. \\n\\nSwai began his comeback in late May when he ran the Trib 10K, finishing 16th in \\n30 minutes 8 seconds. \\n\\nSince then, however, Swai has won two races, the Coronado Half Marathon in \\nJuly, which he finished in 1:04.50, and the Goodwill Games 10-kilometer run \\nlast month in Seattle. \\n\\nThe Goodwill Games victory came despite Swai\\'s taking a wrong turn and running \\n150 yards in another direction before getting back on track. \\n\\nNow Swai, 26, is looking to turn in a 1:02 or 1:03 on Sunday. He insists he\\'ll \\nneed that kind of a time to beat a bevy of Mexican and African runners. \\n\\nThe runners Swai fears most include: \\n\\nCarlos Ayala of Mexico City, who finished fourth in this year\\'s Grandma\\'s \\nMarathon; Jose Luis Chuela of Mexico, who was second in this race in 1988 \\n(1:03:42); Sam Sitonik of Kenya, who placed fourth in the 1987 America\\'s Finest \\nCity Half Marathon at 1:06:01; and Sammy Rotich, a Kenyan who ran a personal \\nbest 1:01:55 in 1987. \\n\\nThe women\\'s field is led by Kim Jones of Spokane, Wash.

Chong Sung-kwa, was involved in the slaying. The charge was not based on concrete evidence but on what he did after Kim killed Pak. Accordingly, Chong was nearby when Pak was killed, and a member of the investigation questioned him at the commander\\'s office on three occasions suspecting him to be part of a military elite meeting.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nSeoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- The joint \\nmilitary-prosecution investigation team, which probed the \\nassassination of President Pak Chong-hui by then Central \\nIntelligence Agency Director Kim Chae-kyu in October 1979, had \\nfound no evidence that then Army Chief of Staff and martial law \\ncommander, Gen. Chong Sung-hwa, was an accomplice in the \\nslaying, a former team member testified recently. \\n  Paek Tong-nim, 57, who served as chief investigator of the \\nDefense Security Command and concurrently as a key member of the \\njoint investigating team, told the prosecution that no concrete \\nevidence of Chong\\'s involvement had been detected in the course \\nof probing the assassin Kim, according to a spokesman for the \\nSeoul District Public Prosecutor\\'s Office. \\n  The joint investigation headquarters\\' announcement on Dec. \\n24, 1979, charging Chong with high treason was based not on any \\nconcrete evidence but on what he did after after Kim killed Pak \\non the night of Oct. 26, 1979, Paek was quoted as saying. \\n  The Seoul District Public Prosecutor\\'s Office is looking \\ninto \\na criminal suit filed by the victims of the Dec. 12 \"coup \\nd\\'etat-like incident of the Army\" against the perpetrators, \\nincluding former Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. Chong \\nSung-hwa is one of the victims. \\n  Paek dismissed as \"not true\" then Defense Minister No \\nChae-hyon\\'s statement on Dec. 13, 1979, that martial Law \\nCommander Chong was arrested for interrogation because new \\nevidence was discovered in the course of investigating the \\nassassination. \\n  The joint probe team felt the need to question Chong because \\nwhen Kim killed Pak he was nearby and Prosecutor Chong \\nKyong-sik, a member of the joint team, called on the martial law \\ncommander at his office three times to question him about his \\nactions on the assassination day, Paek was quoted as saying. \\n  Paek said that without evidence supporting his involvement \\nin \\nthe assassination and without then President Choe Kyu-ha\\'s \\npermission, the joint military-prosecution investigation \\nheadquarters, led by then Defense Security Commander Maj. Gen. \\nChon Tu-hwan forcibly arrested Chong, seemingly because of the \\nheadquarters\\' \"political motive,\" suggesting that the Dec. 12 \\nincident was a mutiny by the \"new military elite\" to topple the \\ngovernment. \\n  The prosecution is considering summoning lawyer Won \\nKang-hui, \\nwho as military prosecutor indicted Chong Sung-hwa on charges of \\nabetting high treason, for questioning. \\n  Won recently said there was no criminal evidence against \\nChong when he indicted him, adding the military prosecution then \\nmade \"a different evaluation\" of his actions on the \\nassassination day. \\n  The prosecution is expected to shortly conclude its probe \\ninto whether Chong was an accomplice in the slaying of Pak \\nChong-hui in October 1979. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nBen Johnson was second in his first race since the ban.

Skinner charged Bauer with misunderstanding the debt burden of poor countries. Bauer comments that the loans do not increase with inflation and are at zero interest. Further, these loans are often canceled or rescheduled. b. Skinner claimed that Africa\\'s poverty is externally-caused. Bauer believes that it is domestically-caused by government policies. c. Bauer believes that the poor are at the bottom of the priority list of local rulers. d.Skinner\\'s encouragement of default is counter-productive. Bauer points to the success of Southeast Asia.\\nIntroduction:\\nSir, Mr James Skinner (Letters, April 11) charges me with misuse of\\nstatistics and understanding the debt burden of poor countries. He cites\\nAfrica to support his contention.\\nThe statistics I used refer to Latin America, the principal thrust of the\\nargument of the Bishop of Oxford, which focused largely on Brazil. The bulk\\nof African debt is owed to official lenders under various aid agreements.\\nThe debts represent loans with a substantial grant element.\\nThe limiting case is the international development association loans,\\n50-year loans, unindexed for inflation, at zero interest. The debts of\\nAfrican countries have often been cancelled or rescheduled, frequently\\nseveral times for the same country. To treat debt as necessarily burdensome\\nalso ignores the initial transfer of resources.\\nThis is like saying that banks, building societies, and governments issuing\\nsaving certificates are burdened when they pay interest. If the funds are\\nused productively, debt service is not a burden in the critical sense that\\nthe debtors would be better off if they had not borrowed.\\nI do not know what Mr Skinner has in mind in referring to institutions\\nserving only western interests, and by clear implication inflict suffering\\non the poor. What I do know is that throughout Asia, Africa and Latin\\nAmerica the level of material achievement declines as we move away from the\\neffect of western commerce.\\nTo harp on alleged external causes of Third World poverty diverts attention\\nfrom the real factors behind this poverty which are domestic, and thereby\\nfrom the possibilities of addressing these. These factors include, among\\nothers, government policies and extensive, often enforced, dependence on\\nprecarious subsistence production.\\nIt is pertinent also that the poorest are low among the priorities of the\\nlocal rulers. State help for the poorest, especially the rural poor,\\nconflicts with the political and personal interests of the rulers, and may\\nnot accord with local mores. Such considerations are reinforced by\\nubiquitous civil conflict. An Arab-dominated Sudanese government will not\\nhelp the poorest blacks hundreds of miles away with whom it is in armed\\nconflict; the Sinhalese government will not help the Tamil poor, nor will\\nthe government of Ethiopia the poor of Tigre.\\nAs I said in my letter, harping on alleged western causes of Third World\\npoverty reflects and reinforces feelings of guilt, which is a self-centred\\nsentiment. Encouraging Third World countries to default inhibits the inflow\\nof productive commercial capital, which, together with the skills that went\\nwith it, over the last 150 years transformed life in many poor countries,\\nnotably in south-east Asia, west Africa and Latin America.\\nBauer\\nHouse of Lords,\\nWestminster SW1\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nWorkman tunneling under the English Channel Tuesday created the first land link between Britain and France when British workers sent a two-inch wide probe through to their French colleagues.

Carbon particles indicate\\nthe exhaust of a passing truck was the culprit. And there are other\\nways to tell a fire was accidental.\\n   ``You eliminate all those causes, you\\'re down to arson,\\'\\' said\\nDale Smallwood, a criminal investigator for Missouri\\'s Mark Twain\\nNational Forest.\\n   He comes down to arson in most of his investigations _ and he\\nand other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted in\\nsome regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames.\\n   A psychologist\\'s study found economic and even aesthetic reasons\\nwhy some people light woods aflame.\\n   Arsonists set 172 of the 296 Mark Twain fires that have broken\\nout so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, Smallwood\\nsaid. A total of 14,200 acres of the forest, which covers 1.5\\nmillion acres mostly in southern Missouri, were burned during a\\nspring fire season made more volatile by drought.\\n   On average, Smallwood estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires\\neach year in Missouri are deliberately set.\\n   ``It\\'s probably 90 percent higher than the national average,\\'\\'\\nsaid Ron McDonald, Mark Twain\\'s fire control officer. He said Mark\\nTwain consistently is among the five forest districts with the\\nworst arson problem.\\n   ``It\\'s just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary (deliberately\\nset) fires,\\'\\' McDonald said.\\n   The tradition seems to stretch across the southern United\\nStates, according to Smallwood. Fires in other areas are more\\nlikely to be caused by lightning or man\\'s carelessness.\\n   As one of the Forest Service\\'s 125 special law enforcement\\nagents, Smallwood has spent most of the past 16 years investigating\\nfires in the forests he loves. ``I consider myself an Ozark\\nhillbilly,\\'\\' he said.\\n   The Forest Service is charged with protecting wildlands, and\\nbalancing recreational needs with commercial interests in timber\\nand mineral resources.

Another tactic is to launch verbal attacks such as the one against Congressman DeConcini, a former opponent of gun control measures who had changed his views. Leading the gun lobby charge is the National Rifle Association. It continues to use its interpretation of the Second Amendment to the Constitution as the cornerstone of its opposition. Gun crimes, however, continue to bring more public pressure against the NRA and for gun control legislation.\\nIntroduction:\\nIN BLOOD-RED letters, the sign on the front window of the Dealers Outlet gun \\nstore in suburban Phoenix declared: \"Urgent! Act Now! Stop the Gun Ban!\" \\nInside, customers took time out from browsing through AK-47 assault rifles and \\na flock of other firearms to sign a petition -- and to vent their wrath at a \\nlocal \"turncoat,\" U.S. Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.). \\n\\n\"We are petitioning to protest the semiautomatic gun-control bills before \\nCongress,\" read the text above a fast-growing list of names. \"If we allow the \\ngovernment to become involved in any type of gun control, we are violating a \\nbasic constitutional right, the right to keep and bear arms.\" \\n\\nThe petitioners\\' target that sunny day last spring was DeConcini, a longtime \\nopponent of gun-control measures who had suddenly switched sides, sponsoring \\none of the nine bills currently in Congress to ban the sale of assault weapons. \\n\"I\\'m a one-issue voter, and I\\'m going to do everything in my power to take \\nDeConcini out,\" George Hiers, a burly man on crutches, vowed as he bought a \\nsemiautomatic shotgun for his wife to defend herself with while he\\'s away on \\nhunting trips. \\n\\nThe attack on DeConcini was stirred up by the National Rifle Assn. in a display \\nof fury that represented far more than retaliation against a former supporter. \\nLong described as \"the powerful gun lobby,\" the NRA is now scrambling to \\nrecover from stunning setbacks in the past three years. Over the NRA\\'s \\nopposition, Congress and state legislatures have enacted legislation banning \\n\"cop-killer bullets\" that penetrate protective vests, plastic guns that can be \\nslipped past metal detectors and \"Saturday night specials\" that are used in \\nmany crimes. And most recently, the group found itself caught in the furor over \\nassault weapons that was ignited by the massacre of five children in a Stockton \\nschoolyard last January. Those killings, combined with the increasing use of \\nthe weapons by drug dealers and youth gangs, have exacerbated the contentious \\nrelations between the NRA and its former allies. \\n\\nLaw-enforcement leaders, concerned about rising violence and terrorism, have \\nended their friendliness toward the gun lobby and become well-organized in \\nopposition. Politicians once fearful of the NRA have been much more willing to \\nstand up to it; President Bush, an NRA \"Life Member,\" on July 7 imposed a \\npermanent ban on imports of assault rifles and has proposed limiting the \\nsemiautomatics\\' ammunition clips. The ban so infuriated some NRA members that \\nthey have launched petition drives in two dozen states to oust Bush from the \\norganization. Meanwhile, California, whose voters only seven years ago defeated \\nan initiative that would have frozen the number of handguns in the state, last \\nMay became the first state to ban assault weapons. At the same time, \\ngun-control organizations are beginning to match the NRA\\'s mass mailings, ads \\nand lobbying; many schools are showing \"Guns and the Constitution,\" an anti-gun \\nvideo produced by Handgun Control Inc., whose chairwoman is Sarah Brady, wife \\nof former White House Press Secretary James Brady, who was disabled by gunfire \\nin the 1981 assassination attempt on then-President Reagan. \\n\\nAnd the NRA even is feeling pressure from more-militant gun groups that \\nthreaten to drain away members and funds. Although enjoying a membership surge, \\nthe NRA ran up a record $5.9-million deficit last year after spending more than \\n$83 million. \\n\\nThus, in fending off the assaults on assault weapons, the 118-year-old NRA is \\nfacing what its leaders call its most daunting challenge. \\n\\n\"We\\'re at a crossroads,\" James Jay Baker, the NRA\\'s top congressional lobbyist, \\nacknowledged as DeConcini\\'s assault-weapons bill cleared its first Senate \\nhurdle in April. \"We\\'re going to go down the road of either prohibitive \\nfirearms regulations or tough criminal justice provisions\" -- that is, more \\nprosecutors, penalties and prisons, the course sought by the NRA. \"Once you get \\ninto a (gun-control) rut, it\\'s tough to get out of that rut.\" \\n\\nAside from the nation\\'s capital, two of the hottest battlegrounds in the \\nassault-weapons fight are Arizona and Florida. That would seem ironic, since \\nguns permeate the cultures of those generally conservative states. But with \\nopinion polls in both states showing that large majorities of residents support \\nbans -- and with police complaining about being outgunned by criminals -- \\nlegislators have moved into action, spurring angry counterattacks from the NRA. \\n\\n\\nCall Now! Write Today! \\n\\nAS PAT JONAS signed the petition in the gun store near Phoenix, one could \\nwitness the NRA\\'s true political power: mobilizing citizens at the grass roots. \\n\"I don\\'t want to see guns outlawed,\" Jonas said, \"because I like to collect \\nguns.\" Probably no other organization in the world floods government officials \\nwith as many phone calls, letters, telegrams and visits from its members as the \\nNRA. Charles J. Orasin, president of 15-year-old Handgun Control -- the NRA\\'s \\nchief nemesis -- estimates that as many as 500,000 members of the NRA and other \\ngun groups regularly lobby elected officials and bureaucrats. \\n\\nThe outpouring is prompted by red-alert mailings churned out by NRA leaders, \\nall sounding essentially the same alarm: They\\'re out to get your guns. These \\nletters go not only to the NRA\\'s 2.9 million members, whose $25 annual \\nmembership fee brings such benefits as a magazine, gun-theft insurance and \\nsafety instruction, but also to 10,000 affiliated hunting organizations and \\nshooting-competition groups. \\n\\nTime and again, the NRA has proved that citizen action generated by such \\nmailings can have far more effect on legislation than opinion polls, especially \\nwhen a majority for gun control is relatively silent. \"If a lawmaker is looking \\nfor an excuse to vote with the NRA, all he has to say is, \\'I got a hundred \\ncalls from the NRA, but none from the other side,\\' \" said a congressional aide. \\nAnd in a close election, a well-organized, single-interest group such as the \\nNRA can wield decisive power by turning out highly motivated voters. \\n\\nIt was one of these red-alert warnings, written by NRA lobbyist Baker, that had \\nbeen delivered to 100,000 gun owners in Arizona and riled up the customers at \\nthe Dealers Outlet outside Phoenix. Baker\\'s letter assailed DeConcini\\'s bill, a \\nscaled-down version of the one enacted by California in May. DeConcini\\'s bill \\ncalls for a nationwide ban on sales of AK-47s and eight other semiautomatic \\nrifles -- guns enjoying wide popularity because they have the menacing look and \\nmuch of the firepower of fully automatic assault weapons used by the military \\nand police. (Automatic guns fire 20 bullets or so per trigger pull; \\nsemiautomatics fire one bullet per trigger squeeze, but a fast index finger can \\nget off as many as 20 shots in five seconds as ammunition is automatically \\nreloaded from a clip. And many semiautomatics can easily be converted to \\nautomatic weapons.) \\n\\nIn his letter, Baker called DeConcini\\'s proposal a \"tragic mistake,\" charging \\nthat it could even block sales of traditional hunting rifles and lead to \\ncriminal charges against 30 million sportsmen who own semiautomatic guns. \"Does \\nanyone seriously believe (Senate Bill) 747 will stop drug smugglers . . . who \\nbring cocaine by the planeload . . . from bringing in any guns they want and \\nselling them on the profitable black market Senator DeConcini\\'s bill will \\ncreate?\" Baker\\'s letter asked. It concluded with a call to arms, warning that \\nDeConcini \"needs to know we will not allow our constitutional freedoms to be \\nstrangled by restrictions that have absolutely no effect on the criminals who \\nare supposed to be the real target! . . . CALL NOW! WRITE TODAY!\" \\n\\n\\n\"Lies and Exaggerations\" \\n\\nGUN OWNERS\\' rage spread quickly after the NRA letter hit Arizona the last week \\nof April. In three weeks, DeConcini\\'s office received 6,395 calls and letters \\nagainst his bill and 68 for it, despite a poll indicating that more than \\ntwo-thirds of the people in metropolitan Phoenix favor some kind of ban on \\nassault weapons. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve been to the four corners of Arizona, and people are shocked and dismayed\" \\nby DeConcini\\'s bill, said Landis Aden, a motorcycle-riding computer technician \\nwho lobbies part time for the Arizona NRA. Aden believes that semiautomatic \\nguns would come in handy if a Mexican revolution spilled over the border and \\nArizonans got caught in the cross fire. \"You could defend your farm or your \\nranch fairly well,\" he said. \\n\\nMartin Mandall, a brash Scottsdale gun dealer who insisted that a reporter feel \\nthe thrill of firing Uzi and AK-47 machine guns at a range in his store \\nbasement, vowed during a conversation there to \"work with the utmost severity \\nto get DeConcini out of office.\" He said he had sold three years\\' stock of \\nassault rifles in the two weeks after Bush issued a temporary import ban in \\nMarch. \\n\\n\"People are talking recall here,\" said Lee Echols, range master for the Phoenix \\nRod and Gun Club. \"We stood behind DeConcini at the last election, and we feel \\nhe has completely betrayed us.\" Another member of the club, Bill Houston, \\ntelephoned DeConcini aide Matthew McCoy in his Washington office to protest. \\nMcCoy\\'s end of the conversation went this way: \\n\\n\"You\\'re misinterpreting the legislation. . . . Recall election? I think that \\nwill hurt everybody and not help anybody. . . . You think that by attempting to \\nburn your friends you can . . . If the alternative were something more strict \\nthan DeConcini\\'s legislation, how would you feel then? Metzenbaum is going to \\ncome from somewhere out of left field.\" Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) is \\npushing a ban that is much broader than DeConcini\\'s. \\n\\nInterviewed in his Phoenix office as the firestorm was building, a serene \\nDeConcini accused the NRA of \"lies and exaggerations\" about his bill; he \\nstrongly disputed the NRA\\'s claim that a provision banning any gun \"nearly \\nidentical\" to the nine listed in the measure could be interpreted to cover \\nvirtually all semiautomatics. The recently re-elected senator said he was \\ntrying to head off more-drastic legislation from Metzenbaum and others, \\nincluding California Democratic Reps. Howard L. Berman of Panorama City and \\nFortney H. (Pete) Stark of Oakland. \\n\\nBut DeConcini was also careful to take political cover behind two Republicans \\nwho are NRA \"Life Members.\" He noted Bush\\'s import ban and cited a salty \\ndeclaration by Barry M. Goldwater, Arizona\\'s venerable former senator, that \\nsemiautomatic guns \"have no place in anybody\\'s arsenal. If any S.O.B. can\\'t hit \\na deer with one shot, then he ought to quit shooting.\" (Goldwater made the \\nremark shortly after appearing in a full-page, \"I\\'m the NRA\" ad in Time \\nmagazine.) \\n\\nDeConcini, an NRA \"Person of the Month\" last year, said that NRA officials \\n\"flat told me, \\'We can\\'t negotiate\\' \" on his bill because \"they were burned so \\nbadly last year when they negotiated with (then-Atty. Gen. Edwin) Meese on \\nbanning plastic guns. They said their membership and revenues fell off. . . . \\nNow they need to get members and money, and that\\'s why they\\'re doing this to \\nme. . . . If I weren\\'t a mature person, I\\'d say, \\'Up yours. Now I\\'m going to be \\na gun-control advocate, and you\\'re going to lose me.\\' \" \\n\\nLater, he said at a Senate hearing on his bill: \"By using these tactics, the \\nNRA is succeeding only in alienating its friend closest to the fight.\" \\n\\n\\nFoxes in the Henhouse \\n\\nAS THE NRA waged its war in the West, Marion P. Hammer, a 50-year-old \\ngrandmother with brown bangs, strode to the front of another heated \\nbattleground in Tallahassee, Fla., a packed meeting room in the state\\'s House \\nof Representatives. \\n\\nA subcommittee was getting ready to vote on a bill that would ban a list of \\nsemiautomatic assault weapons, and Hammer had asked to speak against it. Only 4 \\nfeet, 11 inches tall, she could barely be seen as she took the podium. Her gray \\nslacks, blue ruffled blouse and blue suede jacket complemented her steel-blue \\neyes but belied her credentials: prize-winning marksman and hardball lobbyist \\nfor the Florida NRA. \\n\\nTo her supporters, Hammer represents all that is strong about the NRA; to her \\ndetractors, much that is weak. \\n\\nAttacking the crux of the bill, Hammer told the subcommittee: \"You cannot \\ndifferentiate between semiautomatic firearms that look menacing and your \\nroutine sporting firearms because, functionally, they are the same.\" \\n\\nNext, she dealt acidly with one of the NRA\\'s prickliest political problems: \\n\"There are some law-enforcement officers who are NRA members who are against \\nus. I would suggest to you that it would not be the first time that the fox has \\nbeen in the henhouse.\" \\n\\nFinally, as NRA Washington lobbyist Baker had done in his letter to Arizona gun \\nowners, Hammer charged that a loosely worded definition in the Florida bill \\nwould inadvertently ban all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. That is, the ban \\nwould cover not just the targeted guns -- the ones with folding stocks that \\nmake them easy to conceal, pistol grips, huge ammunition clips and flash \\nsuppressors that, according to police, make it easy to spray bullets from the \\nhip. But doomed as well, she claimed, would be firearms of traditional design \\nlong used by hunters and target shooters in one of the nation\\'s gun-owningest \\nstates. \\n\\n\"Taking away firearms from law-abiding citizens who have lawfully owned them \\nfor decades is not the solution\" to violent crime, she declared. \\n\\nOne might have expected the House subcommittee to reject the bill handily on \\nthat April day. After all, two years earlier, Hammer had led a phenomenal \\nvictory for the NRA in Florida, winning passage of measures that threw out all \\nlocally imposed gun restrictions. The action was so sweeping that many Sunshine \\nStaters thought that they had been freed to carry guns openly, Wild West-style. \\nThe Legislature later closed that seeming loophole in the wake of widespread \\nhoots about the \"Gunshine State.\" But it left intact all other provisions, \\nincluding one making it much easier in many areas to obtain a concealed-weapon \\npermit. \\n\\nHammer has skillfully built support for the changes in the gun laws over many \\nyears. Rising at 4 a.m. after less than four hours\\' sleep, chain-smoking \\nfilter-tip cigarettes, sipping diet sodas -- and aided only by one part-time \\nstaffer and a $125,000 yearly budget -- she tirelessly works Capitol corridors \\nand grinds out newsletters aimed at firing up the NRA\\'s 130,000 Florida members \\nto contact their representatives. Once, she threw a party at a firing range for \\nlegislators, aides, spouses and children; hundreds feasted on shrimp and \\noysters, and many took shooting lessons from expert instructors. \\n\\nTestimonials to Hammer\\'s lobbying efforts -- not to mention her marksmanship \\nwith muzzle-loading rifles -- cover the walls of her office. Among the plaques \\nand pictures is a Winchester .30-30 carbine from the National Antique Arms \\nAssn., recognizing her as the first woman to receive its \"Roy Rogers Man of the \\nYear Award.\" \\n\\nDespite her past successes, however, the House panel voted 5-1 to pass the \\nassault-weapons bill along to the full Criminal Justice Committee. Hammer still \\nwould have several opportunities to halt the bill\\'s progress. But the \\nsurprising setback symbolized the NRA\\'s shifting fortunes, not only in Florida, \\nbut across the nation. \\n\\n\"The NRA has been unreasonable with their positions for so long, it\\'s catching \\nup with them now,\" asserted Rep. Ronald A. Silver, a Miami Beach Democrat who \\nchairs the criminal justice panel. One of the NRA\\'s major problems, he said, is \\nthat a number of legislative allies have been angered by its strong-arm tactics \\nwhen the group decided they went astray. \\n\\nDramatic evidence of this cropped up the day before the House action, when Sen. \\nJohn A. Grant Jr., a conservative Tampa Republican who heads a companion Senate \\ncommittee, was being interviewed about prospects for an assault-weapons ban. As \\nHammer sat casually on a table nearby, waiting to request that an NRA videotape \\nbe shown to the panel, Grant remarked that \"the gun lobby is very \\nwell-organized, and I give them credit for being able to rally the troops on \\nvery short notice.\" But asked if the NRA provides accurate information, he \\nresponded, with a backward glance at Hammer: \"Well, sometimes they get a little \\nbit overzealous. When they said I was part of the Gestapo last year, that was a \\nlittle out of order.\" \\n\\nHammer explained later that Grant was referring to a newsletter in which she \\nhad said that a bill in his committee \"sets up a modern-day Gestapo movement\" \\nbecause it threatened to invalidate many concealed-weapon permits. \"I wasn\\'t \\ncalling members of that committee Gestapo,\" she maintained. Nevertheless, Grant \\nwas so enraged that he had an aide call NRA officials in Washington to demand \\nher removal. \\n\\nState Sen. George G. Kirkpatrick Jr. (D-Gainesville) protested in an interview \\nthat he had been savagely attacked by Hammer\\'s group in his latest campaign \\ndespite a \"strong pro-gun\" voting record. \"They wrote the most vicious \\nletters,\" he said. \"They called me Judas\" because he had backed a Senate \\nleadership team viewed by the NRA as sympathetic to controls on handguns and \\nassault weapons. Kirkpatrick, who easily won re-election, predicted that such \\ntactics will backfire. \"Because of the NRA\\'s unwillingness to sit down and work \\nout a reasonable solution to problems perceived by the public, it makes it much \\nmore difficult to get their mission accomplished,\" he said. \\n\\nSaid Hammer: \"He\\'s very bitter, but I have a job to do. We have a right to \\nvigorously oppose anyone whose actions are detrimental to our best interests.\" \\n\\nHammer faces another growing problem: competition from lobbyists on the other \\nside. For instance, the day of the House subcommittee vote on assault weapons, \\nshe was outmaneuvered by Bernard Horn, the state legislative director for \\nHandgun Control, who had flown in from Washington. Horn gave legislators a \\nbooklet picturing both the 27 guns proposed for banning and other semiautomatic \\nrifles that were not on the list but that are popular with hunters. The move \\nwas aimed at shattering the NRA\\'s claim that only cosmetic differences exist \\nbetween assault weapons and sporting guns. \\n\\nThe effect on subcommittee member Carol Hanson (R-Boca Raton) was decisive. \\nBecause of the booklet, she said, she was no longer willing to support merely a \\nlimit on the capacity of ammunition clips -- a fallback position to which \\nHammer had reluctantly acceded. Now, Hanson said, she favored banning the guns \\nthemselves. \\n\\nEventually, Hammer was able to minimize her losses. Instead of banning assault \\nweapons, the Legislature in June created a commission to study them. And, \\ninstead of enacting a seven-day waiting period for gun buyers, as sought by \\nHandgun Control, it required dealers to make a less-comprehensive background \\ncheck by telephoning a police computer. Voters will decide next year whether to \\naccept a three-day waiting period. \\n\\nAlthough a Handgun Control news release declared, \"Florida Deals NRA Fourth \\nLoss of Year,\" Hammer was able to say with some justification, \"I think we did \\npretty good.\" The tide turned her way, she claimed, after legislators saw how \\nstudent demonstrators in China were overwhelmed by troops \"because they were \\nunarmed.\" \\n\\nShortly after adjourning, the Legislature was called back into special session \\nto reconsider a bill that would make it illegal for gun owners to carelessly \\nleave weapons around children. The NRA had helped kill the measure weeks \\nearlier. But after a spate of gun accidents killed three children and wounded \\nthree others in early June, Hammer gave conditional support to the bill, and it \\npassed overwhelmingly. \\n\\n\\nRambo Sells \\n\\nON A BREEZY DAY last spring, a riot of orange- and gold-striped tulips swayed \\noutside the gunmetal gray NRA headquarters in Washington. \\n\\nInside the eight-story building, many of the 365 employees worked on gun-safety \\ncourses, shooting competitions, police firearms training and other services \\nthat predominated at the NRA until heavy lobbying against gun control began in \\nthe 1970s. The shift came after the murders of two Kennedys and a King inspired \\npassage of major federal gun regulations in 1968. \\n\\nIn his seventh-floor office, Jim Baker -- one of five in-house lobbyists \\nsupplemented by four high-powered outsiders -- had put the finishing touches on \\nhis letter to Arizona gun owners, slamming DeConcini\\'s bill. \"I want this \\ncarefully fly-specked\" for mistakes, he told a secretary as he left for lunch. \\n\\nOver a roast beef sandwich and beer at a plush hotel restaurant, the handsome, \\n35-year-old former prosecutor was asked whether Barry Goldwater\\'s assertion \\nthat hunters don\\'t need assault weapons had undermined the NRA\\'s effort to \\nprevent the ban. \\n\\n\"You don\\'t need any particular gun. You don\\'t need to hunt. But I don\\'t think \\nyou should have to justify anything in terms of need. That\\'s a socialist \\nconcept. You ought to be able to own within reasonable limits what you want. \\nThe question is whether these proposals will fight crime effectively, and we \\nthink highly restrictive gun controls are a bankrupt concept.\" \\n\\nBaker argued that claims of assault-weapon violence are grossly exaggerated and \\nthat the Stockton massacre could have been carried out with almost any gun, not \\njust the semiautomatic AK-47 wielded by Patrick Purdy. \\n\\nA bit more candidly, J. Warren Cassidy, the NRA\\'s executive vice president, \\nlater acknowledged that the Goldwater comment had hurt badly. Cassidy said a \\nnumber of concerned NRA members wrote him, asking, \"What are you going to do \\nabout this?\" He wrote back, asking, \"What do you want me to do? I can\\'t recall \\nhim, he\\'s out of office -- he\\'s an American legend.\" But Cassidy noted in the \\ninterview: \"When a guy like Barry or Dennis DeConcini does these things, it\\'s a \\nbelt to the solar plexus, because you\\'ve counted on these fellows.\" \\n\\nTom Korologos, one of the NRA\\'s well-connected outside lobbyists, recalled \\nanother example of the difficulty of fighting off assault-weapon bans. He said \\nthat while touring exhibition booths at the NRA\\'s recent national convention, \\nhe came across \"a basic .22 rifle that had a big banana clip and a big round \\nthing to hold it with. It looked for all the world like Rambo\\'s personal gun.\" \\nKorologos asked the exhibitor, \"Why are you ruining this perfectly legitimate \\nrifle?\" \\n\\n\"Ah,\" came the response, \"but they sell.\" \\n\\nKorologos commented: \"Never mind it doesn\\'t do us any good on Capitol Hill to \\nhave those damn things loose.\" \\n\\nAn NRA operative conceded that, despite a tough \"no-compromise\" resolution \\nunanimously adopted at the national convention, the NRA might have to back a \\ncompromise bill when Congress takes final action on assault weapons. \"We may be \\nbranded as traitors, but that\\'s the nature of the game in this town, to forge \\nagreements and compromises,\" said the source, who requested anonymity. \\n\\nActually, in the face of increasingly well-organized support for gun control, \\nthe NRA grudgingly compromised on cop-killer bullets in 1986 and plastic guns \\nin 1988. \\n\\nTo fight assault-weapon bills, Baker said, the NRA hopes to spend $5 million, \\nmost of it derived from direct-mail appeals. The organization\\'s revenues last \\nyear included $45.4 million from membership dues and $9.4 million from \\ncontributions. About one-fourth of the $83.6 million in expenditures was spent \\non lobbying. \\n\\nIn addition, the NRA is continuing to contribute heavily to political \\ncampaigns, despite the disappointments it suffered in last year\\'s elections. In \\n1988, five incumbents and all 15 challengers supported by the NRA were \\ndefeated; although 182 incumbents won, the NRA netted no gain with the $770,000 \\nit poured into campaigns. \\n\\nFor the assault-weapons fight, the NRA has sent dozens of police officers to \\nWashington to offset pro-ban lobbying by police chiefs, launched a national \\nnewspaper and TV ad campaign and continued to make available to gun owners a \\n900 toll phone number that has already produced thousands of NRA form letters \\nto President Bush and members of Congress. \\n\\nBaker denied that NRA officials had anything to do with the petition drive to \\npurge Bush from membership, saying that it originated with rank-and-filers \\n\"obviously disappointed with the President\\'s first six months in office.\" But \\nhe added that the NRA board of directors would be forced to consider the matter \\nat its September meeting. \\n\\nFor a while, the NRA harshly retaliated against police chiefs who spoke out for \\ngun control, seeking to get chiefs fired in Nashville, Tenn., and Baltimore \\nCounty, Md. But Dover, N.H., Chief Charles Reynolds, president of the \\nInternational Assn. of Chiefs of Police, said that he and NRA President Joe \\nFoss recently agreed to \"keep the debate issue-oriented, without personal \\nattacks.\" \\n\\nThe most frequent charge against the NRA is the one leveled by DeConcini -- \\nthat it lies and exaggerates. Denying this, Baker said \"a survey of Congress\" \\nby the American Library Assn. had found that the library group and the NRA \\n\"supplied the most accurate information\" of all lobbying organizations. In \\ntruth, the compliment appeared in a Library Journal gossip column, citing only \\nthe opinion of \"a highly placed library source in Washington, D.C.\" GraceAnne \\nDeCandido, who wrote the item, said it was based on \"dinner-table conversation\" \\nwith a government bureaucrat. \"To have the NRA use that in support of their \\npolicies is beyond ludicrous,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nA Prayer for Arms \\n\\nAT THE NRA\\'s national convention in April, more than 16,000 people roamed \\nacross 160,000 square feet of exhibits at St. Louis\\' convention center. They \\nshouldered pea-green SIG assault rifles. They clicked the triggers of \\nsuper-light Glock 17 pistols. They marveled at new laser targeting devices that \\ncan project a red beam hundreds of feet, from gun to bull\\'s-eye. \\n\\nAnd then, during a break, 1,000 NRA activists filed into a cavernous hall where \\nMerrill L. (Pete) Petoskey, a wildlife biologist from Lewiston, Mich., \\ndelivered the opening prayer at the NRA\\'s 118th annual meeting. \\n\\n \"Dear God, Creator of all ... \\n\\n \"Please give us the direction to make (gun-control advocates) understand that \\nthe actions of criminals, who should be confined, should not be dramatized into \\nlegislation that will impose on the rights of millions of law-abiding citizens \\nto own and bear arms for lawful pursuits of recreation and self-defense. \\n\\n \"Please help and guide the leaders of the National Rifle Association and of \\nthis nation to preserve and strengthen this freedom and this right. \\n\\n \"Amen.\" \\n\\n Addressing the meeting, NRA President Foss acknowledged that the beleaguered \\ngroup could, indeed, use more help.

The barometric pressure at Gilbert\\'s center measured 26.13 inches, the lowest ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. With storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the center, Gilbert was also one of the largest. Gilbert is only one of three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere since detailed records have been kept. Gilbert\\'s storm surge, the great dome of water that follows the eye and accounts of 90% of fatalities, is only 8-12 feet, less that Camille\\'s which was 25 feet.\\nIntroduction:\\n   With the winds of Hurricane Gilbert clocked at 175\\nmiles per hour, U.S. weather officials called Gilbert the most\\nintense hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.\\n   Mark Zimmer, a meterologist at the National Hurricane Center,\\nreported an Air Force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric\\npressure at Gilbert\\'s center at 26.13 inches at 5:52 p.m. EDT on\\nTuesday. Gilbert was barreling toward Mexico\\'s Yucatan Peninsula.\\n   ``That\\'s the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western\\nHemisphere,\\'\\' Zimmer said. The previous record low pressure of\\n26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck\\nthe Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph, killing 408 people, he\\nsaid.\\n   With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and\\n200 miles south of the hurricane\\'s center, Gilbert also was one of\\nthe largest. But because the circumference of a hurricane changes\\nso often during its course, no records are kept on their overall\\nsize, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.\\n   Hurricane Debby, which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to\\nhurricane strength before striking Mexico last month, was probably\\nabout half that size, Moore said.\\n   Gilbert is one of only three Category 5 storms in the hemisphere\\nsince weather officials began keeping detailed records. The others\\nwere the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which\\nbulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot\\nwave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.\\n   A 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster\\nin U.S. history, however. That storm hit Galveston, Texas, Sept. 8\\nand killed more than 6,000 people.\\n   Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph, barometric\\npressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18\\nfeet.\\n   The storm surge _ a great dome of water that follows the eye of\\nthe hurricane across coastlines, bulldozing everything in its path\\n_ accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.\\n   Camille\\'s storm surge was 25 feet high, but the hurricane center\\nwas forecasting a surge of only 8-12 feet for Gilbert, Zimmer said.\\n   The damage from these worst-case hurricanes is catastrophic _\\nshrubs and trees blown down, all street signs gone, roofs and\\nwindows blown away and shattered, and mobile homes destroyed.\\n   ``Moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane,\\'\\' Zimmer\\nsaid. ``The engine itself is this tall chimney of warm, moist air\\nin the center.

For the last 18 months, the Shining Path has been taking a more public role in the slums, labor unions, and student groups, and with its newspaper \"El Diario\". Believed to have only about 5,000 armed combatants, the group has struck in the mountains, worked with drug traffickers in the jungle, and bought weapons with profits.

Now strong opposition comes from presidential candidate Ross Perot and working class Hispanic Americans who say NAFTA will cost jobs. White House polls show President Bush\\'s support for NAFTA is a winning issue. Trade lobbyists think Democrats will use it as a weapon, citing his 1991 commitment to environmental issues and labor. Democratic frontrunner Clinton will likely deem NAFTA the wrong kind of agreement. The environment, farm and labor coalition will not support NAFTA without environment or food safety provisions.\\nIntroduction:\\nJUST weeks ago, the prospects for the North American free trade agreement\\nseemed assured.\\nThe proposed pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had the support of the\\nRepublican establishment, of Governor Bill Clinton, the prospective\\nDemocratic nominee, of the powerful Texas Democrats on Capitol Hill and most\\nof the Democratic leadership in Congress.\\nBut the outpouring of public disaffection for \\'politics as usual\\' has pushed\\nto the forefront of many polls in the US election campaign Mr Ross Perot,\\nthe Texas billionaire. His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs,\\nand he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.\\nThe White House has taken its own polls and remains convinced that President\\nBush\\'s support for Nafta is a winning issue. Although many working class\\nHispanic Americans believe Nafta would cost jobs, the Latino business\\norganisations cautiously support the pact.\\nUnder the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congress\\nto vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Nafta\\napproved by Congress this year. Between retirements and election defeats,\\none-quarter to a one-third of the House could change, and no one can foresee\\nthe prevailing sentiment on trade issues.\\nThe president is expected to stage a high profile initialing of the\\nagreement at the most politically opportune time.\\nPolitically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executive\\ndirector of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as a\\nweapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to\\nMexico.\\nA centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to the\\nCongress in May 1991, in which he committed himself to action on\\nenvironmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance.\\n\\'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if they\\ndon\\'t send a complete package in these three areas, the Congressional\\nDemocrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn\\'t\\nmatter,\\' said Mr Freeman.\\nGovernor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the \\'wrong kind of Nafta\\'.\\nThe environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared its\\nground well in the House.

The governors\\' proposal will cost $2 billion per year in addition to the $100 billion now spent on poverty programs. Reagan doesn\\'t like their plan\\'s national minimum benefit level, which he believes will undercut each states\\' ability to set its own standard. Several states have already launched successful work-for-welfare programs, thus encouraging many other states to try something similar. Reform consensus seems to be building.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nWhile there is agreement in virtually every quarter that something needs to be done about welfare, disagreement remains over exactly what to do. \\nThe White House has a formula for welfare reform, as do Sens. \\nMoynihan and Kennedy. \\nNow the nation\\'s governors are asking Washington to adopt their plan. \\n\\n\\nMeeting this week in Washington, the governors said they want to transform the current welfare system -- largely an income-maintenance system -- into more of a job-support system. \\nThey would require all able-bodied welfare recipients (except mothers with children under 3 years of age) to work in exchange for their benefits. \\nThose who do would be eligible for help with education and training, day care and transportation. \\n\\n\\nMany states already have launched work-for-welfare experiments. \\nThe results in Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Utah have been promising. \\nSubstantial numbers of welfare recipients have moved into jobs and off the public rolls. \\nThese successes have encouraged the governors of New York, New Jersey, Washington and Missouri to undertake their own reform programs. \\n\\n\\nThe leaders of the National Governors Association came away from a White House meeting this past Tuesday pleasantly surprised that they were able to reach an accord with the president on many points. \\nThe conference\\'s chairman, Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, even backed off earlier criticism of the administration\\'s welfare plan, saying after the White House meeting, \"I feel better about the prospects of welfare reform than I did yesterday.\" \\n\\n\\nThat is not to say the president agreed with the governors on every count. \\nOne item on the governors\\' agenda that Mr. Reagan didn\\'t go for was a national minimum level for an individual recipients\\'s welfare benefits. \\nBy endorsing a federal welfare standard, the administration would undercut its own proposal to give the states wider latitude to set their own welfare criteria and standards, tailored to their populations. \\n\\n\\nThe most unattractive feature of the governors\\' welfare plan is its price tag -- up to $2 billion a year on top of the $100 billion-plus already devoted to assorted anti-poverty programs. \\nHowever committed the administration and Congress may be to reform, they\\'re unlikely to endorse a plan that increases the deficit. \\n\\n\\nThe governors argue that by spending the extra $2 billion a year, the federal government would be making an investment. \\nBy setting aside more money for job training, day care and other support, they say, taxpayers would ultimately realize savings as welfare recipients are weaned from the public rolls. \\n\\n\\nBut taxpayers can be forgiven if they view this part of the governors\\' argument with skepticism. \\nAfter all, Americans have spent more than $1 trillion over the past two decades to alleviate poverty and curb dependency without seeing evidence of an appreciable return on their substantial investment. \\nAn extra $2 billion a year added to the present anti-poverty programs (which, as we have mentioned before, if simply handed out in cash would be enough to lift every poor household in America above poverty) is unlikely to accomplish all that the governors promise. \\nOversold political programs and promises are largely what got us into this mess. \\n\\n\\nNonetheless there is merit in the governors\\' plan, as there is in the administration\\'s reform proposals, and in the reform bills under consideration in the Senate. \\nMost important, the governors would require that welfare recipients do something productive in exchange for their benefits, be it completing school, receiving vocational training or holding a job. \\nOnly by requiring individual initiative and productivity can welfare recipients ever achieve self-sufficiency. \\n\\n\\nThe degree of consensus forming around welfare reform is unusual. \\nAll the important players -- the president, the governors and congressional leaders -- agree that the goal of such reform is to transform the welfare system into one that enables poor families to achieve, in the president\\'s words, \"real and lasting emancipation\" from welfare dependency. \\nOn this point, at least, there doesn\\'t seem to be much conflict. \\nSince all of the principals agree on the ultimate goal of welfare reform, it seems reasonable to expect that they can achieve a plan of action. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nCalifornians were asked what would state government be like by 1996 if two propositions to limit terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators, on California\\'s November ballot, are passed. Individuals felt there would be all new faces and the people would have more control, politics would not be a profession, expertise would come from the citizenry, and candidates would be more dependent on the party for financing and less dependent of the special interests. On the other side, individuals felt it would be clear that amateurs can\\'t handle the complex job, everyone is a lame duck from the beginning, minorities would lose, and power would go to the executive branch and bureaucrats.\\nIntroduction:\\nTwo propositions on California\\'s Nov. 6 ballot would, among other things, limit \\nthe terms of statewide officeholders and state legislators. Proposition 131 \\nwould limit statewide elected officials to two consecutive four-year terms, \\nstate legislators to 12 consecutive years in office; Proposition 140 would hold \\nAssembly members to six years in office, state senators and statewide elected \\nofficials to eight. \\n\\n If either passes, or both do, what would state government be like by 1996 and \\nthereafter? Would passage of such measures be likely to spur similar \\nlegislation in other states, or at the federal level? The Times asked six \\nlegislators and legislative specialists. \\n\\nRichard L. Mountjoy, member of the state Assembly (R-Monrovia), first elected \\nin 1978, a former general contractor who has served as mayor and city \\ncouncilman of Monrovia (1968-76): \\n\\nBy 1996, there would be all new faces. The argument that the lobbyists would \\ntake advantage of them, I believe, is not valid. \\n\\nTerm limits would give the people of California more control over the \\nLegislature, and the Legislature would be less prone to special interests, \\nbecause legislators would know they are going to be there for six years and \\nthey\\'re out. \\n\\n(Term limits) would stop (politics) from being a professional occupation. For \\nmany members, that\\'s all they\\'ve ever done -- be in the Legislature, \\nlegislative staff. I think it will return the Legislature to more of a \\ncitizen-type legislator. The Legislature, right now, is controlled by those \\npeople who have a vested interest in legislation. \\n\\nI came to the Legislature after eight years on the (Monrovia) City Council. I \\nknew the system there pretty well. I knew how to get things done. I think that \\nthe legislative committee hearings are nothing more than City Council meetings \\non different subject matters. I think that what would happen in the Legislature \\nis more expertise coming out of the citizenry. \\n\\nI think there would be people from all walks of life. I think the age bracket \\nwould creep up a little more. Get people who have been in business. Folks who \\nwant to do it as a public service. At least it would not be dominated by \\nprofessionals. \\n\\nRobert Presley, state senator (D-Riverside) since 1974, formerly a member of \\nthe Riverside County Sheriff\\'s Department for 24 years, 12 of them as \\nundersheriff: \\n\\nMy guess is that in about 20 years, there would be another initiative to change \\n(term limits) because we will have found that (they) didn\\'t work. \\n\\nThe lobbyists are there for a very long time, and they become very expert in \\ntheir fields . . . and will be even more influential, more powerful. They are \\nnot really accountable to anyone except their employers. \\n\\nIt would become clear rather quickly that you have a bunch of elected amateurs \\ntrying to run a very complex, complicated system of state government. We are \\nnot a little backwater state, anymore. We have a population of about 30 million \\npeople. We are growing at the rate of three-quarters of a million people a \\nyear, and that, alone, is hard for people to comprehend. \\n\\nIt is not just the numbers. It is the ethnic mix, the cultural diversity -- all \\nof those things have to be cranked in. So, governing the state of California . \\n. . is not as easy and simple as a lot of people would think. And the other \\nthing a lot of people seem to think is that you the governor -- or you the \\nlegislator -- can get up there and solve these problems tomorrow. Well, there \\nare some of them that are almost not solvable. You have to keep trying. \\n\\nKarl T. Kurtz, director of state services, National Conference of State \\nLegislatures: \\n\\nThe most negative and pernicious impact of term limitations will be on the \\nleadership of the Legislature . . . They need leaders who have a great deal of \\nexperience, skill and ability to lead and to get things done, so that they \\navoid the kind of stalemate we have had in Congress in recent years. \\n\\nBut legislatures also need strong committee chairmen, and term limits mean that \\nrelatively inexperienced people are going to be in leadership and that they are \\n-- by definition -- lame ducks from the very beginning. That is probably the \\nmost negative impact. \\n\\nThere has been a national movement that started in California, 25 years ago, to \\nreally strengthen the role of legislatures and to make them co-equal branches \\nof government; things like term limitations, which would restrict the power and \\nauthority of legislatures, are a step backward in that movement. It would mean \\nthat, in relative terms, the legislatures would cede more power and authority \\nto the executive branch, to lobbyists and to legislative staff. \\n\\nMark P. Petracca, assistant professor of politics and society, UC Irvine: \\n\\nThe national effect would be very impressive because, unlike Oklahoma (where \\nvoters recently approved a 12-year-limit on legislators), which does not have a \\nreputation for being in the vanguard of political change in America, California \\ndoes. Because it is the largest political state in the country, a success for \\neither proposition here is likely to have spinoff moves around the country. . . \\n. Since states do have the power to amend the Constitution on their own, \\nalthough it is much harder to do it that way, it could very well be that the \\ngroundswell of support for (this) movement in some key industrial states would \\nlead to, not only initiatives in those states to restrict their own state \\nlegislative terms, but also . . . a demand for a constitutional amendment to do \\nthe same. \\n\\nAs to what are the implications of term limitations in the state of California, \\na lot of people think that this is a partisan issue. I have tried to make the \\nargument that it is not really partisan at all. \\n\\nThe parties could be helped by this . . . people would have to become more \\ndependent on the party for funding and for guidance, and less dependent on the \\nspecial interests. \\n\\nThe big problem is that nationally -- or locally -- we do not have a culture \\nthat encourages and rewards public service for short periods of time. Democracy \\nrequires that, and yet we do not have it. That is why we created what, in \\neffect, is a professional elite to govern us. Representation does not occur \\nwell then. \\n\\nAntonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund: \\n\\nThe Schabarum initiative (Proposition 140, backed by Los Angeles County \\nSupervisor Pete Schabarum), with a six-year limit (for Assembly members), would \\nhave an adverse effect on the Latino community. We have begun to look at \\nwhether it would violate the Voting Rights Act. \\n\\nRunning for election is a very expensive proposition. For minorities who do not \\nhave a financial base, it is usually extremely hard to raise the money . . . \\nwell-financed, well-organized candidates who are supported by other communities \\nwill have a much better chance. \\n\\nIt seems that as we (Latinos) begin to make entries into the political process, \\nthe rules are beginning to change. Elected officials are supposed to represent \\nthe people who elect them. If there are constant changes, the impact of term \\nlimits would be to empower the bureaucracy -- the people who are not elected -- \\nand (they) would definitely empower the special interests who have the finances \\nand the ability to assist the bureaucrats. \\n\\nBeing an elected official takes experience. The first two years you are just \\nfinding your way around; the second two you are just hitting your stride, and \\nin the third two years, you are on your way out (if 40 passed). It just doesn\\'t \\nmake sense. \\n\\nThere are a lot of problems with our political process, but this is not the \\nsolution. There is some merit to term limits, but they have to be done in a way \\nthat doesn\\'t unduly strengthen the bureaucracy and others who are not elected. \\nWe should throw the rotten apples out, but not the whole system with it. \\n\\nGary C. Jacobson, fellow, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, \\nStanford University; professor of political science, UC San Diego: \\n\\nThe standard argument is that the legislative branch would be weakened. \\nInformation will be held by bureaucrats, staff, special interests. I think that \\nis true, but what we are overlooking are the perverse incentives we set up. \\n\\nInstead of worrying about what their constituents think, as it gets toward the \\nend of their term, legislators are going to be worried about what their next \\nemployer thinks, possibly in the private sector, or in their next constituency, \\nwhich will not necessarily share the same interests as the one that elected \\nthem. \\n\\nSo what it will do is reverse the incentive. If you give someone a job, for \\ninstance, and tell them that no matter how well they do it, they will be fired, \\nthe incentive to do that job well is not there. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nA few weeks before his nomination to the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas outlined his reasons for opposing quotas and affirmative action. He said that his spirit of independence and belief that that everyone should take care of himself were developed in his hardscrabble childhood. He was born near Savannah to an impoverished family. His grandparents raised him after his father deserted the family. The ideals preached by his grandfather were reinforced by a disciplined Catholic education. During his years at Holy Cross College he embraced some liberal views, but he soon renounced them as contrary to his grandfather\\'s values.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nWhat kind of justice would Clarence Thomas, President\\nBush\\'s nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by\\nThurgood Marshall, be? In a series of interviews with me a\\nfew weeks prior to his nomination, Mr. Thomas echoed themes\\nthat run through his articles and speeches over the past\\ndecade.\\n\\n-- \"I don\\'t believe in quotas. America was founded on a\\nphilosophy of individual rights, not group rights. The civil\\nrights movement was at its greatest when it proclaimed the\\nhighest principles on which this country was founded --\\nprinciples such as the Declaration of Independence which were\\nbetrayed in the case of blacks and other minorities.\"\\n\\n-- \"I believe that society is now in a position to\\nvigorously enforce equal rights for all Americans. . . . But\\nI believe in compensation for actual victims, not for people\\nwhose only claim to victimization is that they are members of\\na historically oppressed group.\"\\n\\n-- \"America should not fall into the trap of blaming all\\nthe problems faced by blacks or other minorities on others.\\nWe are not beggars or objects of charity. We don\\'t get\\nsmarter just because we sit next to white people in class,\\nand we don\\'t progress just because society is ready with\\nhandouts. As a people, we need to find solutions to problems\\nthrough independence, perseverance and integrity. As a\\nsociety, we should develop better policies to deal with the\\nunderclass than the failed solutions of the past.\"\\n\\nWhile the views of President Bush\\'s first Supreme Court\\nnominee, David Souter, were virtually unknown before his\\nconfirmation, the 43-year-old Mr. Thomas has boldly\\narticulated his vision of constitutional law, both as a judge\\n-- he now sits on the Court of Appeals for the District of\\nColumbia Circuit, the nation\\'s second-highest bench -- and,\\nbefore that, as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity\\nCommission for eight years.\\n\\n\"Basically the job of a judge is to figure out what the\\nlaw says, not what he wants it to say,\" Mr. Thomas told me.\\n\"There is a difference between the role of a judge and that\\nof a policy maker. {Judge Robert} Bork was right about that,\\nno question. Judging requires a certain impartiality.\"\\n\\nAt the same time, \"impartiality is not the same thing as\\nindifference. This isn\\'t law school speculation. When I hear\\na case, I know damn well that something is going to happen as\\na result of what I decide. People\\'s lives are affected.\\nSometimes a man\\'s life depends on the outcome. And these are\\npeople looking to me, to the judge, to figure out what\\'s\\njust, to correctly apply the law. That\\'s not a responsibility\\nI take lightly. No way.\"\\n\\nMany of Mr. Thomas\\'s critics have taken his unconcealed\\nadmiration for Ronald Reagan, his former boss, and Robert\\nBork, his predecessor on the D.C. Circuit, as evidence that\\nMr. Thomas shares their philosophy of jurisprudence. But in\\nfact, a careful reading of his articles and speeches reveals\\na different sort of judicial conservatism.\\n\\nWriting in the Howard Law Journal in 1987, Mr. Thomas\\nargued for what he called a \"natural law\" or \"higher law\"\\nmode of judging, in which the judge examines not only the\\ntext of the Constitution or statute but also the moral\\nprinciples underlying the American form of government. Mr.\\nThomas maintains, with support from Abraham Lincoln and\\nabolitionist Frederick Douglass, that the Constitution must\\nbe read in the context of the principle of equality inherent\\nin the Declaration of Independence.\\n\\nIn a powerful speech Mr. Thomas gave on Martin Luther King\\nDay three years ago, he defended certain forms of civil\\ndisobedience. King often quoted Thomas Aquinas\\'s statement,\\n\"An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal\\nlaw and natural law.\" Part of King\\'s legacy, for Mr. Thomas,\\nis his reflection on the close connection between law and\\nmorality.\\n\\nPresident Bush\\'s nominee understands the hostility he is\\nlikely to face in Congress. \"When you\\'re up before those\\nconfirmation hearings, it\\'s like going through Dante\\'s\\nInferno. . . . I\\'ve seen a glimpse of that process. When you\\nget up there, you just hope that you don\\'t get destroyed so\\nthat even if you don\\'t make it, you can go on with your\\nlife.\"\\n\\nMr. Thomas is likely to be a very different kind of judge\\nfrom the man he is replacing. When reminded of Thurgood\\nMarshall\\'s comment that he could not wholeheartedly celebrate\\nthe bicentennial of the American founding because the\\nConstitution permitted slavery, Mr. Thomas shook his head. \"I\\nhave felt the pain of racism as much as anyone else,\" Mr.\\nThomas says passionately. \"Yet I am wild about the\\nConstitution and about the Declaration. Abraham Lincoln once\\nsaid that the American founders declared the right of\\nequality whose enforcement would follow as soon as\\ncircumstances permitted. The more I learn about the ideals of\\nthose men, the more enthusiastic I get. . . . I believe in\\nthe American proposition, the American dream, because I\\'ve\\nseen it in my own life.\"\\n\\nMr. Thomas\\'s life is a remarkable story. Born in a small\\nframe house on the outskirts of Savannah, Ga., in 1948, Mr.\\nThomas endured all the hardships of the segregated South. His\\nfather left before he could walk, and his mother worked as a\\nhousemaid and picked crabs from the marsh to eat and sell.\\nThe family shared a single outhouse with several neighbors.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1955, Clarence Thomas and his brother\\nwent to live with their maternal grandparents, who owned an\\nice delivery and fuel oil business. It is here, under the\\nstern tutelage of his grandfather, Myers Anderson, that Mr.\\nThomas locates the beginning of his true education. \"My\\ngrandfather has been the greatest single influence on my\\nlife,\" he claims. In 1987 he told the Atlantic, \"When the\\ncivil rights people indict me, the man they are indicting is\\nthat man. Let them call him from the grave and indict him.\"\\n\\nAs Mr. Thomas remembers, his grandfather believed that\\n\"Man ain\\'t got no business on relief as long as he can work.\\nDamn welfare, that relief]\" At home the Thomas boys worked\\nsix hours a day in addition to school: raising the chickens,\\npigs and cows; cleaning the house and the yard; painting,\\nroofing, plumbing and fixing; maintaining the oil trucks and\\nmaking deliveries.\\n\\nThese lessons of hard work, personal dignity and\\nself-sufficiency were reinforced through years of Catholic\\nschool and college. He finished his undergraduate studies at\\nHoly Cross College in Worcester, Mass. \"That\\'s where I\\nstarted to get political and radical,\" Mr. Thomas recalls. \"I\\nread Malcolm X. I became interested in the Black Panthers.\"\\nIn 1971 he founded the Black Student Union at Holy Cross. He\\nwent on to Yale Law School, where he worked summers at New\\nHaven Legal Assistance, continuing what he calls \"my\\npolitical consciousness raising.\"\\n\\nNevertheless, \"I never gave up my grandfather\\'s ideals,\\nand when my left-wing opinions began to clash with those\\nideals, I began to move away from the left.\" Eventually he\\ntook a job with Missouri Attorney General (now Senator) John\\nDanforth because \"he promised to treat me like anyone else.\\nHe promised to ignore the hell out of me.\"\\n\\nAt a conference of black conservatives in San Francisco,\\nCalif., Mr. Thomas\\'s eloquent departures from the civil\\nrights orthodoxy on quotas and government handouts greatly\\nimpressed the newly installed Reagan administration, and in\\n1981 he was nominated to be assistant secretary for civil\\nrights in the Department of Education.\\n\\nThe next year he was promoted to the top job of the EEOC.\\nUnder the Carter administration, the agency had zealously\\npromoted numerical goals and timetables. \"Thomas came in, and\\nhe rejected all that,\" remarks William Robinson, dean of the\\nDistrict of Columbia School of Law.\\n\\nMr. Thomas had his skirmishes with the Leadership\\nConference on Civil Rights, an umbrella group instrumental in\\ndefeating the Bork nomination, and he made a dangerous enemy\\nin the American Association of Retired Persons, which accused\\nhim of letting legal protections for the elderly lapse. When\\nhe was nominated to the D.C. Circuit in late 1989, a number\\nof these special interest groups prepared for a bloodbath.\\nBut the storm clouds melted away and Mr. Thomas was approved\\nby the Senate Judiciary with a 12-1 majority. The full Senate\\nseated him with only two senators opposed. The reason for the\\nsmooth passage, EEOC vice chairman Ricky Silber man (whose\\nhusband Laurence Silberman sits on the D.C. Circuit with Mr.\\nThomas and is his closest friend on the bench) thinks, is\\nthat \"Clarence has an amazing ability to neutralize\\nopposition. Just as in his life, he turns negative values\\ninto positive values, an amazing feat.\"\\n\\nCan Clarence Thomas be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\\nEven liberal judges will go on record praising Mr. Thomas.\\n\"If I or a member of my family were in trouble, he is the\\nkind of person I\\'d like to appear before,\" Judge Damon Keith,\\na Carter appointee on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in\\nDetroit said in an interview. \"Our judicial philosophy may\\nnot be the same, but he is a bright and reflective man who\\nbelieves passionately in fairness. I say this without\\nreservation, and in full knowledge of all the people who\\ncomplain about him.\"\\n\\nDean Robinson added, \"People often confuse what Clarence\\nthinks with what some of his friends on the right think, but\\nClarence is his own man.\" While at the EEOC, Mr. Thomas gave\\nspeeches accusing the Republican Party of \"blatant\\nindifference\" toward black voters, and chastised Ronald\\nReagan in particular for letting Bob Jones University get\\naway with racial discrimination, and for \"foot dragging\" on\\nthe Voting Rights Act extension.\\n\\nMr. Thomas and his wife Virginia live in Northern Virginia\\nwith Jamal, Mr. Thomas\\'s son from a previous marriage. Some\\nweeks before word of the nomination came, Mr. Thomas\\nconfessed to being slightly bemused by all the attention\\nbeing paid to him by scholars and courtwatchers. \"The problem\\nfor my opponents, and for my friends, is that I don\\'t think I\\nfit any of these molds very well. Once people figure this\\nout, maybe they\\'ll leave me alone.\"\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nA total eclipse will arc from southeast Finland, across northeastern U.S.S.R to the Alaskan Aleutian Islands. The best place for observation will be in the Soviet Union. In Helsinki, the total eclipse begins at 4:52 a.m. and will last 83 seconds. Best viewing in Finland will be in Joensuu, where about 10,000 people, including 3000 foreigners are expected to converge. In Joensuu the sun will be 5 degrees above the horizon, compared with 1 degree above in Helsinki. Skies may be cloudy. Some viewers will be above the clouds.

The \\nlegislative committee monitors state funds disbursed to police departments by \\nthe state Police Officer Standards and Training Commission. \\n\\nThe incident received nationwide attention after a camera hidden in Jackson\\'s \\ncar videotaped the arrest, during which Dickey swore at Jackson after stopping \\nhis car for an alleged traffic violation and then appeared to push his head \\nthrough a plate-glass window. \\n\\nJackson, a Hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave and a self-styled \\ncrusader against police brutality, had gone to Long Beach that night with an \\nNBC television crew following in a separate vehicle in what he termed a \"sting\" \\noperation to validate reports of racism and brutality by Long Beach police \\nofficers. \\n\\nInvestigations have been launched by the FBI, the Los Angeles County district \\nattorney\\'s office and the Long Beach Police Department. Dickey has been \\ntemporarily reassigned to a desk job, and Jackson was charged with interfering \\nwith a police officer. \\n\\nAt the hearing, Boatwright repeatedly played the videotape while committee \\nmembers and about 50 observers watched on television monitors and Dickey and \\nJackson commented on each scene. \\n\\nBoatwright questioned whether the car in which Jackson was riding was actually \\nweaving -- the stated cause for the traffic stop -- and whether Jackson acted \\naggressively toward the officers, as Dickey said in his report. \\n\\nAt one point, Boatwright asked Dickey: \"You became the judge, jury and \\nexecutioner as to whether he was challenged to a fight?\" \\n\\n\"No,\" Dickey tersely replied. \\n\\nDickey\\'s attorney, Michael Hannon, refused to allow Dickey to answer any more \\nquestions after nearly three hours of questioning because of what he called the \\n\"hostile and badgering\" nature of the inquiry. \\n\\n\"This little kangaroo court gives these politicians a chance to run for office. \\nAny resemblance between this and a fair hearing is just imaginary,\" Hannon told \\nreporters afterward. \"They are taking stuff out of context and just badgering \\nhim with it.\" \\n\\nEarlier, under questioning by Boatwright and as the videotape was played, \\nDickey testified that the alleged infraction for which the Jackson car was \\nstopped -- crossing the center divider -- occurred before it could be seen on a \\ntape shot from the NBC chase vehicle, but he maintained that the tape does show \\nJackson\\'s car weaving slowly within the traffic lane. \\n\\nBoatwright, standing in front of the television monitor, pointed out that a \\nvideotape shot from the Jackson car\\'s rear window shows the street lights \\npassing by in a consistent pattern -- indicating the car was not weaving. \\nDickey acknowledged that the police car he was driving \"was weaving all over, \\ntoo\" as it tailed Jackson\\'s car. \\n\\nJackson, also testifying under subpoena, said that he and Jeff Hill, an \\noff-duty federal corrections officer who drove the car, took great care not to \\nbreak traffic laws when they cruised along Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach. \\nHe alleged that in addition to pushing his face into the glass, Dickey hurt him \\nby bending his fingers while handcuffing him and pushed his face into the hood \\nof the police car. Also, Jackson alleged, officers refused three requests to \\nloosen his handcuffs as he was taken to the police station. \\n\\nDickey\\'s eight-page police report, which was provided to reporters, states that \\nJackson was arrested for saying \"offensive words,\" an allegation that was later \\ndropped. But Dickey conceded at the hearing that it was he, not Jackson, who \\nuttered obscenities. \\n\\n\\nNo Taunts Heard \\n\\nThe report states that Jackson challenged the officer to fight, although \\nJackson never is heard taunting the officer on the tape. \"There can be a fight \\nwithout a verbal challenge,\" Dickey said, adding that Jackson\\'s fists were \\nclenched at his sides. \\n\\nDickey said that he was swearing to try to alleviate his fear. He testified \\nthat he thought Jackson, who immediately stepped out of the car after it came \\nto a halt, might be trying to provide a diversion for an armed partner in the \\ncar. \\n\\nHe said his actions were an attempt to \"accomplish my No. 1 job that night: to \\ngo home in one piece.\" \\n\\nAt one point in the proceeding, Boatwright had Dickey and Jackson weighed in an \\nattempt to show that Jackson is shorter and weighs less than the officer. \\n\\nAt another point, Boatwright assumed the role of Dickey and had Dickey play \\nJackson in trying to demonstrate the type of hold Dickey used on Jackson during \\nthe arrest. Boatwright contended that in using that type of hold the officer \\nwould have had to push Jackson into the window deliberately. Dickey denied it. \\n\\nThe officer said Jackson\\'s face crashed through the window when Jackson \\nsuddenly pulled forward. Jackson, according to Dickey, struck the window with \\nhis elbows and not with his face as Jackson contends. Dickey, who cut his hand, \\nnoted that Jackson suffered no facial injuries when the glass shattered. \\n\\nJackson, in his testimony, defended his self-appointed role as a police \\nanti-brutality activist, saying \"my duty is to uphold the law and I am doing \\nthat in the highest tradition.\" He said he is troubled, though, that Long Beach \\npolice are investigating his background on the Hawthorne Police Department \\nrather than concentrating on the incident. \\n\\nBoatwright adjourned the hearing, which was held at the Hall of Administration \\nin downtown Los Angeles, after about six hours of testimony. He said it would \\nreconvene later to hear from the additional witnesses. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nA United States Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt attack jet crashed Thursday, killing seven people on the ground while cutting a wide swath through a working class neighborhood in the West German town of Remscheid.

Despite assurances from the British government that the beef is safe, some are skeptical and the price of British beef is dropping. British officials believe that France and West Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. European Community commissioners have also protested the import ban. On May 11 it was reported that a Siamese cat had died from a form of BSE and the press went wild suggesting that if cats can get it people can too.\\nIntroduction:\\n\"Mad cow\" disease, an enigmatic nervous disorder that has killed thousands of \\ncattle in Britain, is causing trade friction in Europe and is threatening the \\n$3.7-billion British beef industry. \\n\\nOn Friday, West Germany joined France in a ban on British beef imports, citing \\nhealth fears related to the mysterious ailment, whose technical name is bovine \\nspongiform encephalopathy (BSE). \\n\\nConcern that the disease can be transmitted to humans has made the subject \\nTopic A in the pubs and press of Britain, and has put a serious crimp in \\ndomestic beef sales. Despite assurances from the British government that the \\nbeef is safe, consumers and some scientists remain skeptical. \\n\\nBritish officials complain that the French and German import ban is a result of \\neconomic, not health, concerns. The price of British beef is dropping in the \\nwake of the \"mad cow\" scare. Therefore, British officials believe, France and \\nWest Germany imposed the bans to protect their domestic sales. \\n\\n\"It\\'s totally unjustified and illegal,\" said Patrick Barrow, spokesman for the \\nMeat and Livestock Commission, a trade organization. \\n\\nFrance accounted for slightly more than half of Britain\\'s beef exports last \\nyear, buying 70,000 tons of beef worth $264 million. West Germany bought $50 \\nmillion worth last year. \\n\\nAlthough other countries have recently placed some restrictions on British beef \\nand cattle, the French and German moves were the strongest by far. The United \\nStates does not import British beef and recently rescinded permits for the \\nimportation of live cattle. \\n\\nBritish officials have been joined by European Community commissioners in \\nprotesting the French and Germany import ban. \\n\\nMad cow disease has been responsible for the deaths of nearly 14,000 cows since \\nit was first noticed in the mid-1980s. BSE-infected cows \"degenerate very \\nquickly,\" said a spokeswoman from Britain\\'s Ministry of Agriculture. The cows \\nbecome aggressive and then wobbly-legged before dying. \\n\\nNo one is certain what causes the disease, which affects the cow\\'s brain. But \\nthe prime suspect is tainted cow feed. Some experts believe that cattle \\ncontracted the disease as a result of eating food contaminated with the remains \\nof sheep infected with a BSE-like disease called scrapie. \\n\\nAlthough government and industry officials have been concerned for some time, \\nmad cow disease did not become a household word until recently. \\n\\nOn May 11, the Ministry of Agriculture revealed that a Siamese cat had died \\nfrom a disease identical to BSE. The press went wild with the story, \\nsuggesting, in boldface, that if cats can get it, people can too. Panic ensued. \\n\\n\"BSE has been around for six or seven years,\" said David Lewis of the Meat and \\nLivestock Commission. \"And until the cat, it hadn\\'t been brought into the \\nhome.\" \\n\\nBeef sales dropped, with surveys showing that about a quarter of British \\nhouseholds had stopped eating it. Two thousand schools dropped beef from their \\nmenus. \\n\\nThe government and meat industry fought back. Some regulations were enacted to \\nfight the disease, but more overt was the publicity campaign: Princess Anne \\nsaid her family was still eating British beef. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe unofficial tornado season runs from April through June in Texas and other Tornado Alley states.

In April and June an average of 18 to 19 tornadoes\\noccur each month, but in May, when weather conditions are the most\\nunstable, that average increases to about 36.\\n   A few twisters were already recorded in early March in Texas but\\nthey did little or no damage. A tornado that touched down Tuesday\\nin central Louisiana, near Bunkie, destroyed two brick homes.\\n   ``People should have plans of what they\\'ll do in tornadoes. If\\nthey wait until it gets there, it\\'s going to be too late,\\'\\' said\\nBuddy McIntyre, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.\\n   Last May 22, a killer storm flattened the small West Texas town\\nof Saragosa, killing 30 people and injuring 162. In mid-November,\\n11 people died in East Texas when a series of tornadoes trashed\\ntowns from Cherokee County to the Gulf Coast.\\n   ``A tornado is such a devastating kind of storm. No matter how\\nmuch preparation you do there is some property damage and some loss\\nof life. But there are some things you can do to protect yourself\\nand property,\\'\\' said Laureen Chernow, a spokeswoman for the\\ngovernor\\'s division of emergency management.\\n   One is to know the difference between the tornado watches and\\ntornado warnings issued by the weather service.\\n   A watch means weather conditions are suitable for development of\\na tornado, and people should keep a careful lookout for potential\\nfunnel clouds.\\n   A tornado warning means one has already developed and has been\\nspotted. Take cover immediately and don\\'t go outside, but if you\\nare in a car or mobile home you will be safer taking cover in the\\nnearest ditch or depression.\\n   At home, the best place to stay is a basement or underground\\nstorm shelter. If no such shelter is available, go inside a closet\\nin the center of the house or bathroom or lie flat under a heavy\\ntable.\\n   McIntyre noted that most fatalities in a tornado are from flying\\ndebris, so ``we tell people to squat down, cover their heads and\\npresent a low profile.\\'\\'\\n   James R.

Nationwide estimates are that more than two million Latinos are diabetic. An educational effort is underway in California. Adult onset diabetes is preventable by diet and exercise, and obesity is a predisposing factor. It is believed that Latino immigrants frequently eat a fast or fatty food diet and exercise less, causing obesity and, frequently, diabetes, according to the Diabetes Association, which is sponsoring education programs including information on prevention, symptoms and complications of the disease.\\nIntroduction:\\nConsuelo wishes she could share her First Communion this year with Abuelita. \\nShe misses her grandmother very much. \\n\\nAbuelita was not very old -- just 62 -- but there was not much the doctors \\ncould do to save her life. She had uncontrolled diabetes: her kidneys were \\nfailing, her blood pressure was too high and she finally died of a heart \\nattack. \\n\\nConsuelo and Abuelita aren\\'t actual people, but their story nevertheless is \\nplayed over and over again among the more than 3 million Latinos in the Los \\nAngeles metropolitan area, health officials say. The reason is diabetes, a \\nsilent killer that afflicts one in eight Latino adults. This rate is higher \\nthan that of any ethnic group except for American Indians. \\n\\nNationwide, it is estimated that there are more than 2 million Latinos who \\nalready have diabetes, many of them undiagnosed. \\n\\nThat is why the American Diabetes Assn. and other health education groups in \\nthe Los Angeles area and California have begun a major push to educate Latinos \\nabout diabetes. The effort is being aided by interested physicians and by drug \\ncompanies, which make insulin and other drugs used for diabetes that can\\'t be \\ncontrolled by changes in eating habits. \\n\\nLike heart disease, the adult-onset diabetes most common among Latinos is a \\ncondition that can be largely prevented with proper diet and exercise, doctors \\nsay. Being 20% or more overweight is one of the major diabetes risk factors. \\n\\n\"We need to get into the communities and start teaching the kids and the \\nadolescents and the parents to make some changes in their habits,\" said Dr. \\nJaime Davidson, a Dallas physician who has spearheaded the diabetes \\nassociation\\'s Latino education efforts. \\n\\n\"Many people think that when Latinos come here (to the United States) they gain \\nweight because they continue to eat the way they ate at home. But in fact, they \\nchange,\" Davidson said. \"What happens is, fast foods are readily available . . \\n. and they are higher in fat and calories. And at home they didn\\'t have a car, \\nand here instead of walking we take the car to go one block. \\n\\n\"That ends in having more obesity. If you have already a predisposed group of \\npeople, such as the Latinos, you get more obesity and you get more diabetes.\" \\n\\nWith funding from Upjohn Co., the Los Angeles chapter of the American Diabetes \\nAssn. sponsored a diabetes health fair at Olvera Street Plaza on Aug. 26. Of \\n3,000 who attended the fair, 1,000 underwent tests for diabetes. \\n\\nMore of this kind of effort and wider education among the public and physicians \\ncan be expected in the future, said Janet Matkin, of the association\\'s \\nCalifornia affiliate. \\n\\nDiabetes is a defect in the body\\'s system for using sugar in the blood. It \\nresults from the body\\'s failure to make insulin or, some studies indicate, from \\nits inability to use insulin that is available. \\n\\nLatinos are more than twice as likely to get diabetes than are Anglos, and \\nincidence of the disease increases with age. In one survey done in San Antonio, \\na third of the Latinos between the ages of 55 and 65 had diabetes, Davidson \\nsaid. Latinos\\' higher susceptibility is thought to result from a combination of \\nboth heredity and diet. \\n\\nSimilarly, American Indians have the highest diabetes incidence of any ethnic \\ngroup in the United States. Genetically controlled defects in the body\\'s \\ninsulin system are also thought to exist both for them and Latinos. \\n\\nIn addition, Latino diets can be rich in high-calorie fried foods that promote \\nobesity and increase the chance of getting diabetes. \\n\\nDiabetes that begins in childhood requires daily insulin injections. Most \\ncommonly in Latinos, however, diabetes takes the form called Type II, which \\nfirst appears in adulthood and often can be controlled with proper diet and \\nexercise. The disease tends to show up in the late 20s and early 30s among \\nLatinos, a decade earlier than it does in Anglos, Davidson said. \\n\\nBut, because it progresses slowly, Type II diabetes can go undiagnosed for \\nyears, allowing complications such as kidney failure, heart disease, blindness \\nand the need for amputation of a foot or toe. \\n\\nLatinos, who often have less access to regular health care than Anglos, are \\nmore likely to go undiagnosed, Matkin said. \\n\\nThe new educational efforts to change that picture are necessary, not only \\nbecause they help individuals stay healthy but also because the nation\\'s health \\ncare funding crisis will only get worse if the problem is not reduced, Davidson \\nsaid. \\n\\n\"We are facing a problem that is going to grow, maybe at epidemic proportions,\" \\nDavidson said. \"In some states like California or Texas, if nothing is done \\nwe\\'re going to pay so much money for health care for people of Latino origin \\nthat it may become prohibitive.\" \\n\\nThe number of Latino diabetics in the United States will nearly quadruple by \\nthe year 2000 to 8 million, according to projections by Eli Lilly Co. Caring \\nfor them will cost more than $10 billion a year, even if the disease has no \\ncomplications, the company projects. \\n\\nYet life-style changes today to cut down on obesity can prevent many of those \\ncases from ever occurring, health officials say. That means adapting an \\nAnglo-oriented health education network to the needs of a diverse Latino \\ncommunity that has a different social structure, health beliefs and eating \\nhabits from the majority culture. \\n\\nFor instance, the fact that Type II diabetes frequently shows up in women \\nduring or shortly after pregnancy gives health educators an ideal chance to \\ninfluence an entire Latino family\\'s eating habits, said Dr. Martin Montoro, \\nco-director of the diabetes and pregnancy service at Los Angeles County-USC \\nMedical Center. \\n\\nAny Latino woman whose child was born at 9 pounds or larger should consider \\nherself at risk of diabetes and alter her diet, Davidson said. \\n\\nRecent immigrants and even some longtime U.S. residents are not likely to want \\nto switch completely away from a diet reliant on beans, tortillas and other \\ncarbohydrates, Montoro noted, but modifications can be made easily. One of the \\nmost important is to cut down on fat in the diet by eliminating fried foods -- \\nfor instance, by not frying tortillas for tacos or enchiladas. \\n\\nOther barriers to Latinos getting care for diabetes are more subtle, doctors \\ninterested in the issue say. \\n\\nChief among these is that the Latino patient is less likely to volunteer \\ninformation or to notice early diabetes symptoms than the Anglo patient, said \\nDr. Aliza Lifshitz, a board member of the California Hispanic American Medical \\nAssn. \\n\\nAny physician practicing in Southern California needs to be aware of that and \\nto learn to ask more diabetes-related questions of their Latino patients, \\nLifshitz said. \\n\\nDavidson said he is confident that Latinos will respond to education efforts on \\ndiabetes. He pointed to the recent indications that Americans\\' risk of heart \\ndisease is lowering as examples of how educational programs can work. \\n\\n\"I think that if we give them the opportunity and the tools that Latinos are no \\ndifferent than anybody else,\" Davidson said. \"We need to give them the \\nopportunity to enter the health care system, and we need to give them the \\nopportunity to learn that diabetes is the biggest health care issue that they \\nare going to face into the year 2000.\" \\n\\n\\nFACTS ON DIABETES \\n\\nEARLY WARNING SIGNS OF DIABETES \\n\\n* Excessive thirst \\n\\n* Frequent urination, including having to get up in the middle of the night \\n\\n* Wounds that take longer than usual to heal \\n\\n* Excessive weight gain during pregnancy; giving birth to a baby weighing more \\nthan 9 pounds \\n\\n* Extreme hunger \\n\\n* Blurred vision \\n\\n* Dramatic weight loss \\n\\n* Itching \\n\\n* Fatigue \\n\\nHOW TO AVOID DIABETES \\n\\n* Eat less to get rid of extra pounds.

The British government has taken steps to stop the spread of the disease, while compensating owners for animals destroyed, and assuring the public that there is little chance of risk to human health. Nevertheless, several countries have imposed an embargo on the export of cattle from Britain. Two dozen cases of a human disease related to Mad Cow disease were reported in Britain last year.\\nIntroduction:\\n\"Mad cow disease\" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for \\nBritain\\'s cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. \\n\\nThe government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human \\nhealth, but scientists still aren\\'t certain what causes the disease or how it \\nis transmitted. \\n\\n\"I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,\" says Martin Raff, a \\nneurobiologist at University College, London. \"But they certainly are not zero. \\nI have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder.\" \\n\\nMad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed \\nonly in 1986. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which \\nhas been in Britain since the 1700s. The incurable disease eats holes in the \\nbrains of its victims; in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger \\ndrunkenly. \\n\\nThe suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which \\nused to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement. \\n\\nThe government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and \\nlater banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal \\ncord in food for humans. Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed. \\n\\nIn March, the government announced that it would pay farmers 100% of market \\nvalue or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed \\nwith BSE. \\n\\n\"I think it is a recognition -- not just of pressure from farmers -- but that \\nthe public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be \\nlikely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100% compensation,\" said \\nSir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union. \\n\\nThe disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. \"In the course of 24 \\nhours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and \\ntotally disoriented.\" \\n\\nAs of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 \\ncattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE. \\n\\nThe government has paid $6.1 million in compensation, and is budgeting $16 \\nmillion for 1990. \\n\\nIreland\\'s Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been \\nconfirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of \\nNorthern Ireland. \\n\\nBecause of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s Animal and Plant \\nHealth Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull \\nsemen from Britain, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. \\n\\nSimilar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West \\nGermany and New Zealand, according to the Agriculture Ministry, and the \\nEuropean Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 \\nmonths. \\n\\nDavid Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of \"BSE hysteria\" \\nin the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is \\n\"remote.\" \\n\\nThe government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease. \\n\\nA commission chaired by Sir Richard Southwood, a professor at Oxford \\nUniversity, reported last year that the cause of BSE \"is quite unlike any \\nbacteria or known viruses.\" \\n\\nThe report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy \\nanimals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies. \\n\\nThe Southwood report said it is \"most unlikely\" that the disease poses a threat \\nto humans. But the report added: \"If our assessments of these likelihoods are \\nincorrect, the implications would be extremely serious.\" \\n\\nThere is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as \\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease. About two dozen cases were reported in Britain last \\nyear. \\n\\nAnother form, known as kuru, had been found in cannibals in New Guinea. \\n\\nAccording to a report in the British Medical Journal, the incidence of \\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease is no higher in Britain than it is in countries free \\nof scrapie. \\n\\n\"It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect \\nof BSE on human health,\" a consultative committee reported to the Agriculture \\nMinistry. The committee\\'s report, released early this year, said it is only a \\n\"shrewd guess\" that BSE is transmitted through sheep offal in cattle feed. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe 1988 blazes at Yellowstone have flamed out but the controversy they kindled is still smoldering. It is sure to leave its mark on future fire and management policies throughout the vast system of national parks and wilderness areas. Arguments still rage over the impact of fires on wildlife, the conduct of officials responsible for monitoring the blazes, and the role of the media in creating an erroneous impression that a national treasure had been somehow reduced to cinders. In response, the Interior Department, parent of the National Park Service, has already ordered a summer-long moratorium on its politically sensitive \"let-burn\" policy.\\nIntroduction:\\nThis has always been a land of stark contrasts and magnificent subtleties, \\nnever more so than in the aftermath of last summer\\'s spectacular season of fire \\nwhich scorched enough timber and meadow to rival Rhode Island in size. \\n\\nFrom the sky where the graceful bald eagles soar, the oldest and grandest of \\nour national parks now resembles a peculiar marble cake, baked by the caprice \\nof nature into patternless swirls of vegetation and death. \\n\\n\\nMuch Unscathed \\n\\nDespite infernos that whipped through the treetops like blast furnaces, most of \\nthe pristine landscape emerged unscathed, as did the elusive grizzly bears in \\nthe high country, the resilient herds of elk and bison and the famous geysers \\nthat fill the air with eerie puffs of steam and mist. With the last of the \\nwinter snow rapidly melting, much of Yellowstone is bathed in the glorious hues \\nof spring. \\n\\nBut cut into the green are huge gashes of once-thriving forest that now appear \\neither pitch black or rusty brown, depending on whether the trees were roasted \\nor merely singed. Either way, they\\'re dead. \\n\\nOnce-lush hillsides are now covered by little more than the skeletons of \\nstately lodgepole pines. Their needles, twigs and even limbs gone up in smoke, \\nsome of these \"widowmakers,\" as loggers call them, still jut precariously from \\nthe charred dirt. Others lay scattered across the ground like giant \\npick-up-sticks. \\n\\nDown at ground level, the same scenery is a thing of beauty, not devastation, \\nto the eyes of soil scientist Henry Shovic. He turns a spade of blackened earth \\nand finds rich brown soil just beneath the crust, a sign that the forest not \\nonly remains fertile but will soon be teeming with new life. \\n\\nAlready, clumps of grasses are beginning to jut to the surface and here and \\nthere a yellow buttercup or purple shooting star has also broken through. In a \\nfew weeks, meadow floors will be carpeted in a thick blanket of wildflowers. \\n\"Did you see the green?\" asks Shovic, ecstatic. \"I\\'m amazed. It\\'s going to be a \\npicture postcard.\" \\n\\n\\nSpring Brings Rebirth \\n\\nSpring has come to Yellowstone and with it an inspiring process of rebirth and \\nrenewal. But while the 1988 blazes have long since flamed out, the controversy \\nthey kindled is still smoldering. It is sure to leave its mark on future fire \\nand management policies not just at Yellowstone but throughout the vast system \\nof national parks and wilderness areas. \\n\\n\"It was a hell of a summer, let me tell you,\" said Yellowstone Supt. Bob \\nBarbee. \\n\\nArguments still rage over the impact of the fires on wildlife, the conduct of \\nofficials responsible for monitoring the blazes and the role of the media and \\nothers in creating an erroneous impression that a national treasure had somehow \\nbeen reduced to cinders. \\n\\nThe debate has also served to underscore a basic conflict in the mission of \\nnational parks as set out by Congress. On the one hand, they are supposed to be \\npreserves of the past, the last outposts in America where nature is allowed to \\ntake its course with as little intrusion as possible from man. On the other \\nhand, they are also set aside as vacation and tourist havens for the taxpayers, \\nwho, after all, pay the bills. \\n\\nIf nothing else, said James Agee, a forest ecology specialist at the University \\nof Washington, the furor raised by the fires should force environmentalists to \\ntemper their purist approach to park management. Ecologists argue that \\nwildfires clear away dead timber and overgrowth and are vital to the \\nrejuvenation of forests. \\n\\n\\nTied to Neighbors \\n\\nBut \"parks can no longer be considered ecological and sociological islands,\" \\nAgee told a conference of conservationists here over the weekend. \"They are \\ninextricably tied to their neighbors for better or worse.\" \\n\\nSome movement in that direction may already be under way. The Interior \\nDepartment, parent of the National Park Service, has already ordered a \\nsummer-long moratorium on its politically sensitive \"let-burn\" policy, under \\nwhich lightning-triggered blazes are allowed to burn unless they threaten human \\nlives or property. The edict applies to all but two parks in Florida. \\n\\n\"With the exception of Big Cypress and the Everglades, we will be in full \\nsuppression mode,\" a park service spokesman explained. \\n\\nAnd, after a sweeping review and nationwide public hearings, the agency has \\ntentatively decided to modify -- though not flatly abandon -- the controversial \\nfire strategy once the moratorium expires. Under the changes, expected to be \\nannounced shortly by Bush Administration officials, all parks would have to run \\nthrough a safety check list that includes an assessment of weather, moisture, \\nwinds and available firefighting crews before they could make a decision on \\nwhether or not to let a lightning fire burn. \\n\\nLeading environmentalists are cautiously optimistic about the new plan because \\nit retains at least a stated commitment to the retention of so-called \"natural\" \\npolicies. At the same time, however, they warn that saddling park managers with \\nextensive conditions could effectively result in quick suppression of all \\nwildfires. \\n\\n\\nMay Become Gun-Shy \\n\\nMichael Scott, regional director of the Wilderness Society, said restrictions \\ncould lead to a \"systematic politicization of ecosystem management\" and make \\nofficials gun-shy about letting fire burn for any reason. \\n\\n\"They\\'re going to say \\'we better just put out the fires,\\' \" Scott predicted. \\n\"There could be a chilling effect on allowing nature to take its course.\" \\n\\nFrom an ecologist\\'s standpoint, the \"let-burn\" policy could be the most serious \\ncasualty of last year\\'s blazes, which swelled to historic proportions and \\nultimately seared nearly 1 million of the park\\'s 2.2 million acres. \\n\\nHeeding complaints that fires were getting out of hand and could threaten \\nsurrounding communities, officials suspended the policy by mid-July. And some \\nof last year\\'s most destructive blazes were triggered by man, not nature, and \\nfought from the first sign of smoke. Eventually 25,000 firefighters were called \\nin from around the nation and the bill for suppression efforts soared to $120 \\nmillion, nearly 10 times the size of Yellowstone\\'s annual operating budget. \\n\\nAuthorities say the flames were fanned by record drought and gale- force winds \\nand virtually nothing could have stopped them. \"What is most humbling is that \\none-quarter inch of rain and snow on Sept. 11 essentially stopped what the \\ngreatest firefighting effort in history could not,\" argued John Varley, \\nYellowstone\\'s chief scientist. \\n\\nBut many local politicians and residents disagree. They say the park did too \\nlittle, too late and let the fires get out of hand. And many people who live in \\nnearby resort communities remain bitter over what they contend was a \\npreventable tragedy that could scare away tourists and imperil their \\nlivelihoods. \\n\\n\"If (park superintendent) Barbee were here I\\'d choke him to death even today,\" \\nsaid Betty Morton, a motel owner in tiny Cooke City, where the threat of fire \\nforced a temporary evacuation last September. \"Even a 5-year-old child knows if \\nsomething\\'s burning you got to stop it quick. All that stuff about burning\\'s \\ngood for growth is a crock. I\\'ll never see any of it in my lifetime.\" \\n\\n\\nWill Keep Job \\n\\nWhile many critics have called for Barbee\\'s head, Interior Secretary Manuel \\nLujan Jr. said in an interview that the Yellowstone superintendent was in no \\ndanger of losing his job. Still, Lujan, a former New Mexico congressman \\nappointed to his Cabinet post only this year, said park officials should have \\n\"admitted\" that they erred in losing control of the blazes. \\n\\nTo a great extent, lingering resentment over the conduct of firefighting \\nefforts is fueled by economic uncertainty. Morton, for example, said all 12 of \\nthe cabins she rents out are usually reserved for the Memorial Day weekend \\nweeks in advance. This year, only one of the rooms has been taken so far. \\n\\nThere are conflicting signals over what impact the fires have had on the \\ntourist trade. Other independent innkeepers, as well as lodges in the park, \\nalso report that reservations are soft. However, Marsha Karle, a spokeswoman \\nfor the park, said letters and calls logged by Yellowstone operators are about \\ndouble their usual pace and the number of visitors entering the park so far \\nthis spring has been well above normal. \\n\\nThe park has embarked on an unprecedented publicity drive as well as an \\n$8.5-million rehabilitation project to reassure reluctant tourists that it has \\nnot been transformed into a bleak wasteland. The centerpiece of the campaign \\nappears to be an effort to turn what, to some might appear a disaster, into an \\nopportunity. \\n\\n\"Welcome to the New Yellowstone,\" reads the headline on a special fire brochure \\nhanded to each visitor as they drive into the park. \" . . . We have the rare \\nopportunity to witness wildlife regeneration on a scale rarely seen anywhere on \\nEarth.\" \\n\\nA new $250,000 exhibit on fire ecology is under construction, as is a series of \\nwayside exhibits describing various fire scenes. Interpretive programs will \\nfeature talks on fire and its effects and there are even tentative plans to \\ndevelop a children\\'s trail through a fire-damaged area to explain the \\nphenomenon to youngsters. \\n\\n\\nExpect Many Scientists \\n\\nWhile the response from tourists is still questionable, the park is bracing for \\nan unprecedented onslaught of scientists looking into everything from fire \\nbehavior patterns to its effects on grizzly bears, fisheries, grasslands and \\nthe nesting status of bald eagles. \"Hundreds of people are here doing \\nresearch,\" said Karle. \"It\\'s like a big laboratory.\" \\n\\nEven local merchants, suppressing any anguish over the fire and its ultimate \\nimpact, are jumping on the bandwagon. Colorful souvenir books detailing the \\nfires in words and pictures are big sellers at curio shops both in the park and \\ngateway communities. Another hot item: videos. \"Yellowstone -- The Place Where \\nHell Bubbled Up,\" comes in both 90-minute deluxe and 30-minute highlight \\npackages as well as a Japanese narrative version. \\n\\nYellowstone officials are making no apologies for their handling of the fires, \\nwhich they contend was not only ecologically sound but also in concert with \\nthen existing park service regulations. Circling the wagons against critics, \\nthey insist that the uncertainty and furor raised by what happened here \\nresulted largely from media accounts that sometimes wildly exaggerated the \\nextent of the blazes and their impact. \\n\\n\"There was no ecological downside to the fires,\" Barbee said recently. \" . . . \\nThe media, in my opinion, went into a frenzy. They outdid themselves with \\nhyperbole.\" \\n\\nWhether coverage was fair or not, the media\\'s impact on heightening awareness \\nof the situation was clearly considerable. The blazes were probably the first \\nmajor wildfire covered on television by live hourly updates emanating from \\nsatellite trucks in the middle of a forest. \\n\\nLujan\\'s reservations aside, an internal government review has largely backed up \\nthe approach taken by Barbee and other park officials in dealing with the \\nfires. But it did fault the park service for a haphazard public relations job \\nthat fueled confusion. \\n\\n\\nNatural, Beneficial \\n\\nAnother major post-fire study, this one conducted by a panel of experts from \\nseveral major universities, has yet to be released. However, the chairman of \\nthe panel, Duke University botanist Norman L. Christensen, told a congressional \\nhearing last January that he considered the fires to be both natural and \\nbeneficial to the Yellowstone environment. \\n\\n\"Ecologists are in total agreement that wildfires were a natural part of the \\nprimeval North American landscape,\" Christensen testified. \" . . . Although \\nless frequent, fires approaching the size of those in 1988 occurred in the \\n1700s and probably occurred at 200- to 300- year intervals through the Western \\nmountains over the past 10,000 years.\" \\n\\nChristensen said that there is ample evidence that such fires kill few animals \\nand ultimately improve their habitat by promoting the growth of plants and \\nshrubs that could not thrive in the gloom of a thick forest. \\n\\nBob Secter reported from Yellowstone and Maura Dolan from Los Angeles. \\n\\n\\nYELLOWSTONE FIRES \\n\\n1 -- Human-caused fires originating outside of Yellowstone Park \\n\\n2 -- Natural fires originating within Yellowstone Park \\n\\n3 -- Natural fires originating on adjacent U.S. Forest Service lands \\n\\nSOURCE: Yellowstone National Park \\n\\n\\nREFORESTATION IN YELLOWSTONE \\n\\nAbout 80% of the trees burned in the greater Yellowstone Park fires were \\nlodgepole pines, a tree that is self-pruning.

Although Dickey\\'s attorney admitted that the officer was wrong to spice his orders to Jackson with obscenities, Jackson was booked for suspicion of using offensive language as well as challenging an officer to fight and obstructing arrest. The assistant district attorney said that their office has taken on four to six charges of police brutality a year.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe Los Angeles County district attorney\\'s office and the FBI are investigating \\na videotaped incident in which a white Long Beach police officer appeared to \\nshove a black man\\'s face into a plate glass window after a routine traffic \\nstop. \\n\\nThe Long Beach City Council voted Tuesday to ask the district attorney\\'s office \\nto launch an independent investigation of the Saturday night incident, which \\nwas secretly recorded by an NBC television crew. \\n\\nBut Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt Livesay said the office was already looking into \\nthe case at the request of the Long Beach police chief. \\n\\n\"We agreed to review the matter to determine whether a criminal investigation \\nis appropriate,\" Livesay said, adding that his office hopes to decide by Friday \\nwhether a full-fledged investigation is merited. If such an inquiry reveals \\nthat brutality was involved, either misdemeanor or felony charges could be \\nfiled against the officer, he said. \\n\\nThe FBI has also been called in to determine whether the civil rights of the \\nman who was arrested -- Don Jackson, a sergeant on administrative leave from \\nthe Hawthorne Police Department -- were violated during his altercation with \\ntwo Long Beach officers on Pacific Coast Highway, spokesman Fred Reagan said. \\nHe refused to say who had requested the federal investigation. \\n\\n\"We\\'ve had an allegation of a civil rights violation and we opened a ticket on \\nit this morning,\" he said. \\n\\nJackson and Jeff Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, donned dirty \\nold clothes and drove into Long Beach in a rented 12-year-old sedan Saturday \\nnight as the television crew followed behind in a van. The two men said they \\nwanted to demonstrate a long-standing problem of abuse of minority group \\nmembers by Long Beach police officers. \\n\\n\\nFull Tape Withheld \\n\\nWhile edited portions of the tape have been broadcast, Long Beach officials \\nhave said they need to see everything filmed by the NBC crew to move ahead with \\ntheir own investigation of the incident. NBC officials have declined to release \\nthe full tape, saying that it would violate company policy to release unedited \\nfootage. \\n\\nA Long Beach assistant city attorney said his office is considering legal \\naction to obtain the tapes. \\n\\nAlthough Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell told NBC\\'s \"Today Show\" on Tuesday morning \\nthat the two police officers had been suspended, Police Chief Lawrence L. \\nBinkley said that the officers, Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey, will remain on \\nduty at this stage of the investigation. They have, however, been reassigned \\nfrom patrol duty to the detective bureau, he said. \\n\\nKell admitted later Tuesday that he was in error in his \"Today Show\" comments, \\nbut said he would favor firing the officers if it is proved that they used \\nbrutal tactics in dealing with Jackson. \\n\\n\\nCalled \\'Unfortunate\\' \\n\\nAt Tuesday\\'s City Council meeting, the mayor called the incident \"an \\nunfortunate set of circumstances. We will not tolerate this. . . . We need to \\nfind out what happened here and make sure it never happens again.\" \\n\\nAn investigation by the district attorney will add credibility to the city\\'s \\nown consideration of the brutality allegations, Kell said. \\n\\nIt is not unusual for the district attorney to look into allegations of police \\nbrutality, Livesay said, estimating that the office takes on four to six such \\ncases a year. \\n\\nIn determining whether a police officer has used excessive force, prosecutors \\nhave to decide whether the officer acted \"without lawful necessity\" in \\nassaulting or beating a suspect. He declined to detail what would constitute \\nunnecessary force, saying that it would be a \"judgement call\" by prosecutors \\nbased on the actions and statements of the police officers and suspects, and \\nthe injuries suffered. \\n\\nAttorney Michael Hannon, who is representing the two officers, said Tuesday \\nthat he will contest any allegations of brutality. He said the officers were \\n\"set up\" by black activists intent on creating a scene with police. \\n\\n\\nPolice Have No Comment \\n\\nIn a statement released a day after the incident, Long Beach police said that \\nJackson\\'s and Hill\\'s sedan was pulled over for weaving across the center line \\nof the highway. They denied that Jackson\\'s head was shoved through the window, \\nsaying that his elbow smashed the glass. On Monday, however, department \\nofficials stopped releasing that statement and said they would have no comment \\npending the outcome of their internal investigation. \\n\\nA spokesman for the Police Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service, a nonprofit \\ngroup that investigates citizen complaints against law enforcement agencies, \\nsaid the televised tape makes it clear that Dickey pushed Jackson\\'s head and \\nright arm through the window. Spokesman David Lynn maintained that Hill, the \\ndriver of the car, was not violating any traffic laws when he was stopped. \\n\\nThe group also complained that Dickey also used a string of obscenities in his \\nconversation with Jackson, who was booked for suspicion of using offensive \\nlanguage, challenging an officer to fight and obstructing arrest. He was \\nreleased on his own recognizance pending a Jan. 25 court appearance. \\n\\nClarence Smith, the only black member of the Long Beach City Council, said he \\nfound the tape \"shocking.\" But other city officials argued that the television \\nfootage was not necessarily conclusive because it showed the altercation from \\nonly one angle and showed Jackson and Dickey only from the waist up. \\n\\n\"It\\'s real hard to tell what\\'s happening below the waist,\" said Councilman Evan \\nAnderson Braude, maintaining that it is vital that NBC release the rest of its \\nvideotapes. \\n\\n\\nConcedes Error by Officer \\n\\nAttorney Hannon conceded that Dickey was wrong to spice his orders to Jackson \\nwith obscenities, but he said the cursing was evidence of discourtesy, rather \\nthan racism. \\n\\nHe said the two officers saw the car weave within the traffic lane and wanted \\nto check the driver for drunkenness. Although the two men in the car were \\nblack, driving an old car and dressed in shabby clothes, they were not stopped \\nfor those reasons, the lawyer said, adding that they were in a section of the \\ncity where their appearance was not unusual. \\n\\n\"Obviously, they are not telling the truth when they say they did nothing to \\nbring attention to themselves,\" Hannon said of Jackson and Hill. \\n\\nHe said the two police officers become concerned for their safety when Jackson \\nsuspiciously exited the car as soon as it stopped, then immediately started \\narguing when Dickey ordered him to submit to a search for weapons. \\n\\n\\n\\'Proper Police Tactics\\' \\n\\n\"The officer, using proper police tactics, pushed him up (against) the side of \\na building and unfortunately, the window broke,\" Hannon said. \"I\\'m sure neither \\nMr. Jackson nor the officer wanted the window to break, because it was \\ndangerous.\" \\n\\nHe said Jackson had an eye for the camera when he screamed as Dickey moved him \\nover to the police cruiser for arrest. \\n\\nHe said Dickey, who has been on the police force for four years, had one \\nearlier complaint about his conduct, which was investigated by the department \\nand determined to be unfounded. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nTwo days after Slovenia and Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia, the federal government mobilized troops to regain control, beginning with Austrian border crossings. The Slovenian militia, formed in the past several months, is outmatched by the army\\'s 180,000 troops, armored vehicles and air force. Fighting across Slovenia resulted in 100 dead and wounded. The West has lobbied for maintenance of the Yugoslav state, threatening to withhold aid if the country breaks up.

Yesterday, under artillery fire\\nfrom the federal army, they waved a white flag and\\nsurrendered as Yugoslavia lurched closer to civil war.\\n\\nLess than two days after Slovenia and Croatia, two of\\nYugoslavia\\'s six republics, unilaterally seceded from the\\nnation, the federal government in Belgrade mobilized troops\\nto regain control. Accompanied by tanks, jet fighters,\\nhelicopters, the regular troops, including paratroopers,\\nbattled Slovene militiamen across the breakaway republic.\\nThey surrounded the airport near Ljubljana, Slovenia\\'s\\ncapital, and retook Slovenia\\'s main border crossings with\\nAustria, Italy and Hungary, effectively cutting off\\ninternational traffic. Local militiamen shot down a federal\\narmy helicopter as it flew over the capital, killing the\\npilot and co-pilot, the Associated Press reported.\\n\\n                                                                                                    \\n\\n\\nThere were no official reports of casualties. But Slovene\\nDefense Minister Janez Jansa said in a television interview\\nthat fighting was going on in at least 20 places in Slovenia,\\nand he estimated there were more than 100 dead and wounded on\\nboth sides. He claimed six government helicopters had been\\ndowned. \"To put it briefly, Slovenia is at war,\" he said.\\n\\nReuters news service reported from Ljubljana that\\nthousands of local defense forces were patrolling with\\nautomatic weapons. Outside the Slovene capital, government\\narmored vehicles smashed through barricades and road blocks,\\nleaving a trail of twisted metal, flattened cars and\\nshattered glass.\\n\\nIn Croatia, the army moved into areas where fighting\\nerupted between Croats and minority Serbs, Yugoslavia\\'s two\\nlargest nationalities and historic rivals. Four people had\\nbeen killed and 14 hurt Wednesday.\\n\\nThe first shooting between the federal army and the\\nmilitias occurred here, in the mountains that mark the border\\nwith Austria. Throughout the morning, federal soldiers, some\\nbearing bazookas, fanned out in the woods surrounding the\\nSlovenia customs house. Meanwhile, tanks and artillery wound\\nup the narrow mountain pass. In midafternoon, the customs\\nhouse was rattled with a burst of rifle fire and a few\\nminutes later it was rocked by three projectiles from\\nanti-tank guns.\\n\\nThe blasts left holes in the roof and walls and shattered\\nwindows in the house. The Slovenes, about three dozen strong,\\nwaved a white sheet from one of the windows, laid down their\\nweapons and were marched down the road. None of them seemed\\nto be injured.\\n\\nThe scene was like something out of the U.S. Civil War,\\nwhere civilians gathered for picnics to watch the early\\nbattles. Here, the drama was watched by several Yugoslavs\\ntrying to return to their country from Austria; the cooks,\\nwaitresses and a few guests at restaurants on both sides of\\nthe border; several tourists who were caught on the Yugoslav\\nside; and a dozen Austrian customs officers and policemen.\\nThose on the Austrian side gathered near the restaurant\\'s\\nbeer garden and watched through binoculars as the army\\nsoldiers moved through the forest, and then they scrambled\\nfor cover when shots were fired. No spectators were harmed.\\n\\nSlovenes watching the action were horrified, as the\\nconsequences of their independence grab became clear.\\n\"Yesterday we had a big party, and today we\\'re fighting,\"\\nmoaned Bogataj Vejko, a truck driver from near Ljubljana, who\\nhad safely crossed the border early in the morning and was\\nnow trying to get back home. \"We were hoping it wouldn\\'t come\\nto this.\" After the shooting stopped, he talked to a group of\\nthe federal soldiers, and discovered that some were\\nconscripts from Slovenia. \"This is what we have come to,\" he\\nsaid. \"Slovenes shooting at Slovenes.\"\\n\\nAfter the army established control, Milan Jelen, a Slovene\\nbusinessman, reached into the backseat of his car and\\nretrieved his son\\'s toy slingshot. \"Now I\\'ll go at them\\nmyself,\" he joked. Then he turned serious, scoffing, \"Some\\nindependence.\"\\n\\nEmil Herlec, a leader of the local Slovene mountain rescue\\nteam, scrambled up the mountain, through the woods, when he\\nheard the shooting. \"The first shots that have been fired in\\nSlovenia since after World War II,\" he said. \"If we want our\\nfreedom, we will now have to defend it.\"\\n\\nIn Ljubljana, Milan Kucan, Slovenia\\'s president, vowed in\\na television address that the republic\\'s militia would\\nrespond with \"all methods\" to any aggression against his\\n\"independent state.\" He called on Slovenes in the federal\\narmy to desert and join the republic\\'s militia. In Croatia,\\nofficials also vowed to defend their sovereignty.\\n\\nBut the poorly trained and equipped Slovene and Croatian\\nmilitias, formed in the past several months, are no match for\\nthe 180,000-strong federal army. The local militias also have\\nnothing to counter the central government\\'s several thousand\\ntanks and other armored vehicles, not to mention the\\ngovernment\\'s air forces.\\n\\nPolitically, the two republics\\' declarations of\\nindependence have been ignored by the rest of the world,\\nwhich supports a united Yugoslavia. So far, no foreign\\ncountries have recognized Slovenian and Croatian\\nindependence. On the contrary, the European Community and the\\nU.S. have lobbied heavily for the maintainance of the\\nYugoslav state, and have threatened to withhold millions of\\ndollars in aid if the country breaks up.\\n\\nBut U.S. Secretary of State James Baker appealed to\\nBelgrade to find a way for Croatia and Slovenia to express\\ntheir \"national aspirations\" through \"negotiations and\\ndialogue\" rather than bloodshed. Mr. Baker and White House\\nspokesman Marlin Fitzwater had suggested to reporters\\nWednesday that the breakaway republics be granted greater\\nautonomy and sovereignty within a united Yugoslavia.\\n\\nThe federal army, dominated by Serbs, has long warned that\\nit won\\'t stand by while the country disintegrates. And on\\nTuesday night, after the two republics declared their\\nindependence, the federal parliament called on the army to\\nintervene. In a letter to Slovenia\\'s premier, Gen. Konrad\\nKolsek of the federal military district that controls\\nSlovenia said he had orders to seize all border crossings and\\nwould \"crush\" any resistence.\\n\\nThe independence declarations came after months of\\nunsuccessful negotiations among the leaders of the six\\nrepublics over the post-Cold War shape of Yugoslavia. The\\nCommunist leadership of Serbia, Yugoslavia\\'s largest\\nrepublic, insists on strong central control from Belgrade,\\nthe capital of both Serbia and Yugoslavia. The nationalist\\ngovernments of Slovenia and Croatia have been demanding a\\nlooser confederation of sovereign republics.\\n\\nSerbian attempts to deny Croatia and Slovenia their\\nindependence are motivated by two fears. They worry that the\\n600,000 Serbs living in Croatia (about 11% of that republic\\'s\\npopulation) will be discriminated against by the Croatian\\ngovernment. And they fear losing the economic support of\\nSlovenia and Croatia, the two wealthiest republics. On the\\nother hand, Slovenia and Croatia say they could no longer\\ntolerate the erosion of their finances by the\\nSerbian-dominated bureaucracy.\\n\\nTogether, Slovenia, with two million people, and Croatia,\\nwith five million, supply nearly two-thirds of Yugoslavia\\'s\\nforeign exchange and about half of the country\\'s gross\\nnational product. They are also Yugoslavia\\'s gateway to\\nWestern Europe.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nIn May federal health officials announced that the rate of tuberculosis for those in prison might be more than three times as great as for those on the outside. In some states it is even higher. In New Jersey, for example, it is 11 times higher. Tuberculosis is a contagious disease, and those in close contact with an active carrier of tuberculosis are at greater risk. This is a big issue in prisons where there often is overcrowding, poor circulation of air and an environment conducive to the spread of contagious diseases.\\nIntroduction:\\n   The tuberculosis rate in U.S. prisons may be more\\nthan three times higher than on the outside, federal health\\nofficials said Thursday, urging testing, isolation and other\\nmeasures to curb TB behind bars.\\n   Researchers with the Centers for Disease Control cited a survey\\nin 29 states, where prisons reported 31 tuberculosis cases per\\n100,000 inmates in 1984-85, compared with eight cases per 100,000\\nreported among non-incarcerated adults in those states during the\\nsame period.\\n   ``In some large correctional systems, the incidence of TB has\\nincreased dramatically,\\'\\' the CDC said, noting that in New York\\nstate there were 106 TB cases per 100,000 inmates in 1986 _ seven\\ntimes more than the average of 15 cases reported in 1976-78.\\n   In New Jersey, inmates had a TB rate of 110 per 100,000 in 1987,\\n11 times higher than the general New Jersey population.

Cause of this crash has not been ascertained but engine failure seems likely. 154 were killed; a surviving child is in critical condition. The plane had a heavy fuel load and had ten more passengers on board than its seat limit. Engines of the type on the MD82 have had problems in the past and the FBI is investigating reports of engine tampering.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nThe Northwest Airlines jet that crashed Sunday in Detroit, killing at least 154 people, was involved in two incidents of engine failure in the past two years. \\n\\n\\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration records, the McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-82 jet made emergency landings in 1985 and 1986 following the loss of power in one of its two engines. \\nA Northwest spokesman confirmed that the incidents happened, but said they weren\\'t related to Sunday\\'s crash of Flight 255. \\n\\n\\nThough federal investigators were looking into a number of possible causes for the crash, which occurred shortly after takeoff, engine failure appeared to be a likely culprit. \\nAccording to Associated Press reports, some witnesses to the crash, including an air traffic controller, said they saw blue flame coming from one of the jetliner\\'s engines just before it hit the ground and exploded into a fireball. \\n\\n\\nThe accident, the second-deadliest ever in the U.S., could have a broad range of effects on the airline industry regardless of the specific causes, aviation specialists said. \\nFollowing a summer of near-misses, delays and other snafus, some airline specialists said the accident could serve as a catalyst for a reassessment of the nation\\'s air-travel system. \\n\\n\\nUnlike the recent near-misses, the Detroit accident doesn\\'t appear related to air-traffic control problems. \\nEven so, some congressional aides believe there will be a \"spillover\" effect, and that all aviation safety issues will now get closer scrutiny. \\nMoreover, although service problems have been the focus of much of the attention in recent months, the debate may now center more strongly on safety issues. \\n\\n\\n\"There is going to be a lot of noise from Capitol Hill,\" said John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute. \\n\"This one is going under the microscope.\" \\nAdded a Senate Commerce Committee staff member: \"Delays and other consumer concerns will end up in the back seat.\" \\n\\n\\nIn Detroit, federal crash inspectors and representatives of United Technologies Corp.\\'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, the engine maker, arrived at the accident scene. \\nOfficials said that the aircraft\\'s flight recorders, which record cockpit conversations, had been found in wreckage that extended over half a mile. \\n\\n\\nThe MD-82 jet, which has a good safety record, is designed to be able to take off and land even if one engine fails. \\nSafety officials wouldn\\'t speculate on whether the plane\\'s heavy load may have contributed to the crash. \\n\\n\\nIn addition to a large fuel load for the flight to Phoenix, Ariz., the flight was jammed with passengers. \\nThere were 153 people on a plane with 143 passenger seats. \\nThe extras included six crew members, two babies who were being held by passengers and two Northwest employees riding on two of the plane\\'s jump seats. \\nWire-service reports said two persons on the ground also were killed, and that a 4-year-old girl was hospitalized in critical condition. \\nLate last night, the Associated Press reported that the girl was identified by her grandfather. \\nHer father, mother and brother were passengers on the Northwest airliner and died in the crash. \\n\\n\\nThe JT8D-219 engines used on the jet have been the subject of some concern among federal safety officals. \\nIn April, the National Transportation Safety Board urged the FAA to conduct a safety investigation of the 200 series of JT8D engines after some dangerous in-flight engine failures. \\n\\n\\nThe board made the recommendation after a March 23 incident in which an American Airlines MD-82 plane approaching the Minneapolis airport experienced an engine surge and loss of power. \\nThe engine, a JT8D-217A, was shut down, and the plane landed without further trouble. \\nA later inspection showed that all 44 of the pins used to lock jet-engine turbine-vane clusters to the outer part of the turbine case had fractured. \\n\\n\\nThe board recommended that the FAA order inspections of the JT8D engines to detect any pin fractures and to replace existing ones with improved pins. \\nThe board said similar incidents involved Pacific Southwest Airlines and Muse Airlines. \\n\\n\\nThe FAA, in a May 29 response, told the board it essentially agreed with its recommendations and would take steps to require inspections of the engine and replacement of parts where necessary. \\nThe new rules, proposed last month, will go into effect this fall, FAA officials said. \\n\\n\\nIn its April report, the National Transportation Safety Board warned that \"many\" of the 330 MD-80 series airplanes operated by 12 U.S. and 14 foreign airlines world-wide \"are potential candidates\" for engine failure. \\nMore than 900 of the engines have been manufactured, according to the board. \\nHowever, engineering changes have been made in some engines. \\nIn others, airlines have made changes, based on a Pratt &amp; Whitney service bulletin, to reduce the risk of pin failure. \\n\\n\\nThomas Haueter, of the safety recommendations staff of the safety agency, said that the board hadn\\'t put out an emergency recommendation for immediate replacement of the pins because it was unclear if the problems that had occurred were merely isolated incidents or reflected system problems. \\n\\n\\nFAA officials at the crash scene wouldn\\'t speculate on the reasons for the crash or comment on the plane\\'s engines. \\nJohn Lauber, one of five members of the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a news conference at a hotel near the airport last night that there was no evidence at this point that either engine exploded or caught fire during flight. \\nHe stressed that it was too early to draw any firm conclusions. \\nA board spokesman said it will take nine to 12 months to determine the probable cause of the accident. \\n\\n\\nDespite an excellent safety record, Northwest could be hurt in a number of ways by the crash. \\nAmong other things, the accident has focused attention on its recent service problems as well as discord among its workers. \\nThe airline early yesterday denied that its labor troubles may have played a role in the crash. \\n\\n\\nSuch concerns arose following reports of a work slowdown by Northwest mechanics. \\nIn January, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began investigating incidents of alleged tampering with Northwest planes in Minneapolis. \\n\\n\\nNorthwest, a unit of Minneapolis-based NWA Inc., also has had a rash of service problems since its acquisition of Republic Airlines last year. \\nThere were reports yesterday that relatives of crash victims being flown in from Phoenix were asked to switch from one Northwest jet to another because of mechanical problems. \\n\\n\\nThe MD-82 that crashed was a former Republic jet that Northwest acquired as part of the merger. \\nThe two emergency landings that involved the jetliner, number N312RC, took place in Minneapolis and San Francisco. \\nIn the Minneapolis incident, the plane landed missing part of its tail cone. \\nA Northwest spokesman said the engines involved in those two incidents had since been replaced by other JT8D-200 series engines. \\n\\n\\nThe FAA said in Washington that air-traffic controllers in Detroit gave the Northwest flight takeoff clearance for Runway 3C, the center of the airport\\'s three runways. \\nThe controllers reported that shortly after the jetliner lifted off, it pitched from left to right, according to FAA spokesman John Leyden. \\n\\n\\nThen they \"saw a blue flash from the left engine,\" Mr. Leyden said. \\n\"The left wing hit the ground, and the aircraft burst into flames,\" according to the controllers\\' account. \\n\\n\\nFAA records show that besides those incidents that involved the plane that crashed, problems with the turbine sections of JT8D-200 series engines occurred on three Republic flights in the past four years. \\nNone of those problems resulted in a serious accident. \\n\\n\\nIn one such incident, in September 1983, falling debris from an engine caused fire damage to several homes around John Wayne International Airport in Orange County, Calif. \\nIn another incident, at the Detroit airport in October 1985, an engine on an MD-82 \"popped and began to unspool\" on takeoff. \\nLater inspection revealed extensive turbine damage to the engine, the FAA report said. \\n\\n\\nAn FAA official said all jetliners, in order to be certified, must be capable of completing their takeoff ascent even if one engine fails, provided the aircraft is within prescribed weight limits. \\nWhy the Northwest airliner failed to make the climb and whether it was carrying too much weight will be subjects for federal investigators, he said. \\n\\n\\nCongress is expected to act on a half-dozen major aviation bills this fall. \\nStaff members now expect those bills to attract new measures aimed at improving safety. \\n\"Aviation is going to be a hot topic,\" said an aide to Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.). \\n\"When people get back (from their August recess), they will be looking for an opportunity to do something.\" \\n\\n\\nFor example, Sen. Byrd and Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, have already drawn up legislation that would require small planes to be equipped with altitude-reporting devices at hundreds of airports across the U.S. \\n\\n\\nSen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, predicted that the accident will \"accelerate movement by the Congress and the Transportation Department to do whatever can be done -- either by hiring more maintenance inspectors or reducing air traffic to meet the capacity of the system, to reduce the chances of future accidents.\" \\n\\n\\nHe added, \"We will want to hear a thorough examination of everything that took place with that airplane and what was going on at the airport.\" \\n\\n\\nSunday\\'s crash was the first time in 24 years that passengers were killed in an accident involving a Northwest plane. \\nIn June 1963, a DC-7 operating as a military charter crashed into the Pacific Ocean, killing all 101 people onboard. \\nIn March, a commuter plane affiliated with Northwest crashed in Detroit, killing nine people. \\nThe worst airline accident ever in the U.S. was the 1979 crash of an American Airlines jet in Chicago. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nUS cities along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on alert last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after hitting southern Florida leaving at least eight dead, causing severe property damage, and leaving 1.2 million homes without electricity. Gusts of up to 165 mph were recorded. It is the fiercest hurricane to hit the US in decades. As Andrew moved across the Gulf there was concern that it might hit New Orleans, which would be particularly susceptible to flooding, or smash into the concentrated offshore oil facilities.

Their hard-working grandparents took in Clarence and his brother after their own father deserted the family and their mother remarried. Clarence was seven years old and his grandfather taught him perseverance, discipline and the value of hard work. The grandfather enrolled him in a segregated Catholic school in Savannah, and Thomas also credited the nuns for reinforcing the discipline preached by his grandfather.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe label \"black conservative,\" now firmly affixed to Clarence Thomas\\' name,\\ndoes not begin to tell the story of his life, an American story of\\ntransformation.\\nBorn barnyard poor in segregated Georgia, forsaken by\\ntheir father, Thomas and his brother were reared by strict Bible-believing\\ngrandparents who taught him to never say, \"I can\\'t.\"  \\n\\nThomas and his brother made it in the white world.

Washington, who advocated education, self-reliance and\\nmutual support as the principal means of advancement.\\nClarence Thomas was\\nborn June 23, 1948, in Pinpoint, Ga., a town in the marshes near Savannah. His\\nmother, Leola, 18 at the time, lived in a house that had no plumbing.\\nBefore Thomas\\' second birthday, his father moved to the North and left the\\nfamily behind.

French President Mitterand said, \"What a brilliant sign of the vitality of our two countries\". The $16.7-billion Channel tunnel will make it possible to travel from Paris to London by high-speed train in 3-1/2 hours, including 35 minutes through the tunnel. It takes 90 minutes by ferry. The tunnel is viewed positively in France where it is expected to revive economically depressed northern areas. Many Britons fear drug traffickers will invade their island via the tunnel.\\nIntroduction:\\nCheers erupted Saturday on both sides of the English Channel when British and \\nFrench workers digging the Channel Tunnel finally met after knocking out a \\npassage large enough to walk through and shake hands. \\n\\n\"Today, for the first time, men can cross the channel underground,\" French \\nPresident Francois Mitterrand said. \"What a brilliant sign of the vitality of \\nour two countries.\" \\n\\nThe breakthrough came in a 6-foot-tall service tunnel that will be used to \\nmaintain two rail tunnels still being bored. It marked a symbolic milestone in \\nEurope\\'s biggest engineering project. \\n\\nUsing jackhammers, Graham Fagg, 42, of Dover, England, and Philippe Cozette, \\n37, of Calais, France, knocked out the last foot of chalk to link up the \\nBritish and French sides of the tunnel -- which has been dubbed a \"chunnel.\" \\n\\nThe smiling pair then clasped hands, embraced and exchanged their national \\nflags. Workers in overalls looked on and applauded. \\n\\n\"God save the queen!\" cried French workers, uncorking Champagne bottles. \\n\\n\"Vive la France!\" came the reply from the British side. \\n\\nSaturday\\'s handshake came three years to the day after tunneling began at \\nSangatte, near Calais, and in Folkestone, England. \\n\\nThe $16.7-billion Channel Tunnel will make it possible to travel from Paris to \\nLondon by high-speed train in 3 1/2 hours when it opens in June, 1993. \\n\\nThe train trip through just the tunnel is expected to take 35 minutes, compared \\nwith 90 minutes to cross the channel by ferry. \\n\\nFares for the undersea crossing have not been set. But experts say the charges \\nmay be at least double the 1986 projections of $46 per person in a car and $19 \\nper train passenger. \\n\\nThe tunnelers have spent the last month drilling through the last 100 yards of \\nchalk with giant American-built boring machines, trying to align the two \\nhalves. \\n\\nThe British tunnelers actually linked up with the French on Oct. 29, when \\nworkers drilled a 2-inch hole through the chalk in a service tunnel. \\n\\nThe connection ended Britain\\'s island separation from continental Europe for \\nthe first time since the last Ice Age about 8,000 years ago. \\n\\nFagg and Cozette were chosen by draw from among the 3,000 workers to represent \\ntheir countries in Saturday\\'s meeting. After widening the passage from the size \\nof a peephole to a window, they laid down their tools and shook hands. \\n\\n\"Bonjour,\" boomed Fagg. \\n\\n\"Hello,\" Cozette said, chuckling. \\n\\nMichel Delebarre and Malcolm Rifkind, the French and British transportation \\nministers, rode in small service trains down the maintenance tunnel to witness \\nthe handshake. \\n\\nFagg and Rifkind rode on to Sangatte, while Cozette and Delebarre headed for \\nFolkestone to join in celebrations that lasted into the night. \\n\\nNine workers have been killed during the project. The cost has climbed from an \\ninitial estimate of $9.4 billion to $16.7 billion. \\n\\nThe tunnel is viewed positively in France, where it is expected to revive \\neconomically depressed northern areas. But Britain has shown worry over the \\nloss of its historic moat from the Continent. \\n\\nMany Britons fear drug traffickers or terrorists will invade their island via \\nthe tunnel. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe sun, although 400 times wider than the moon, is also 400 times farther away from the earth. Thus, twice a year, when their orbits line up, an eclipse occurs. Fewer than a third are total. Any point on earth is eclipsed just once every 360 years. In the U.S, the 1991 eclipse, one of the centuries best, will be better than those of 1970 and 1979. Scientists discovered helium and confirmed Einstein\\'s theory of bending light through eclipse studies. This time, astronomers will study the sun\\'s upper atmosphere, 11-year sunspot cycle, solar wind and why its outer atmosphere is much hotter than its inner.\\nIntroduction:\\nIt\\'s a coincidence of cosmic proportions. The sun is 400 times wider than the\\nmoon. But the sun also happens to be about 400 times as far away from Earth as\\nthe moon.\\nThe result: From Earth both orbs look almost exactly the same\\nsize. And when the moon\\'s orbit happens to carry it directly across the face\\nof the sun, as it will Thursday, the effect is stunning -- a total solar\\neclipse.  \\n\\n\"It\\'s maybe the greatest natural occurrence one can witness,\" said Larry\\nToy, a Chabot College astronomy professor. \"The phenomenon is just\\nawe-inspiring.\"\\nSolar eclipses occur twice a year, when the sun, moon and\\nearth line up. (This line-up would occur at every new moon, except that the\\nmoon\\'s orbit is tilted so it only crosses the sun\\'s path every six months.);  \\n Because of variations in the moon\\'s orbit, fewer than a third of the solar\\neclipses are total eclipses. In these cases the moon\\'s shadow, up to 200 miles\\nwide on the earth\\'s surface, races west to east along the ground at 1,000 to\\n5,000 miles per hour for a few thousand miles.\\nMost total eclipses get\\nlittle public attention. They occur over water, over the poles or in\\ndifficult-to-reach terrain. On average, any point on Earth is eclipsed just\\nonce every 360 years.\\nBut when the shadow\\'s narrow path does cross\\ninhabited areas, people flock there to experience \"totality\" -- to watch the\\nlight snap off and the stars snap on, and to gaze at the sun\\'s shaggy corona\\nhanging in the dark sky for a few minutes before daylight abruptly returns.\\n In the United States, the opportunity has come twice in the past couple of\\ndecades -- along the East Coast in 1970 and across the Northwest and Northern\\nPlains in 1979.\\nThis Thursday the moon\\'s shadow will be back for another\\nperformance, one of the century\\'s best.\\nIt\\'s unusual for several reasons.\\nAt its peak, observers will see one of the longest-lasting eclipses this\\ncentury -- six minutes, 53 seconds. Also, its 150-mile-wide path across\\nHawaii, Baja California, Mexico City and four Central American capital cities\\n\"puts more people in the moon\\'s shadow than any other eclipse in history,\"\\nsays Alan Dyer, an editor of Astronomy magazine.\\nFinally, since the center\\nof the shadow will pass right across the world\\'s largest cluster of\\nastronomical observatories, the audience will include several dozen solar\\nscientists intent on getting the best view they\\'ve ever had.\\n\"It\\'s going\\nto be great from up there on the mountain,\" said Harold Zirin, a California\\nInstitute of Technology astronomer who will be at one of the observatories\\natop Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano that makes up a large piece of the island of\\nHawaii.\\nHistoric events\\nFor science, two eclipses have proved especially\\nhistoric: In 1868, spectroscopic study of the sun\\'s halo turned up evidence of\\na new element, which was named helium, from Helios, the Greek sun god. And in\\n1919, astronomers spotted a star, which should have been behind the sun,\\ninstead peeking around the edge of the sun. That was the first confirmation of\\nAlbert Einstein\\'s prediction that a star\\'s gravity will bend the path of\\nlight.\\nBut in recent years solar eclipses have declined in significance\\nfor researchers.\\nFor one thing, chasing eclipses by trekking to remote\\nregions with delicate astronomical instruments to capture a few minutes of\\ndata has lost much of its glamour, especially in times of tight budgets.\\nFor another, some of the information now can be gathered any day of the year\\nby using instruments that simulate a solar eclipse.\\nBut this time, the\\neclipse is coming to them, and they can\\'t resist a look. At 13,800 feet, Mauna\\nKea is the world\\'s tallest island mountain. The air above it is still, dry and\\nclean, making it one of the world\\'s choicest spots for viewing the cosmos.\\nIt\\'s so high that oxygen deprivation is a serious concern. And, unlike most\\npeople headed for Hawaii, astronomers will be packing long underwear and down\\njackets in case, as sometimes happens even in July, the temperature at the\\nsummit drops below freezing.\\n7 observatories in use\\nSeven of the nine\\nobservatories atop Mauna Kea will be used Thursday morning. (The Keck\\nObservatory, being built by the University of California and the California\\nInstitute of Technology, is behind its original construction schedule and will\\nnot be completed in time for the eclipse.)\\nWhat they want to know is more\\nabout the temperature and composition of the sun\\'s upper atmosphere -- layers\\ncalled the chromosphere and the corona -- which normally is difficult to\\nexamine against the glare of the sun.\\nThey hope the information will\\nprovide clues to what causes the sun\\'s 11-year cycle of sunspots and flares\\n(now near its peak), what propels the solar wind and why the sun\\'s outer\\natmosphere is, paradoxically, so much hotter than its lower atmosphere.\\nSolar wind studies\\nAt some observatories, astronomers will take repeated\\nphotographs of the corona during the eclipse to study it close up and to watch\\nfor material accelerating outward to become solar wind.\\nOthers will use\\ntelescopes to study the sun\\'s emissions at microwave frequencies to learn more\\ndetails about how its temperature varies with altitude.\\nBut, frankly, the\\nastronomers also want to watch the lights go out.\\nThey\\'ll be fighting the\\ntemptation to abandon their instruments and go outside to watch.\\n\"The\\nbiggest problem,\" Zirin said, \"is whether we\\'re going to see the eclipse.\"  \\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Senate today confirmed Clarence Thomas as a judge to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

Rescue divers were unable to search the overturned vessel because of strong winds and high waves. The search had to be called off but it was hoped that some of the crew were in airtight cabins with enough oxygen to survive. Chantal was expected to hit the western Louisiana or upper Texas coast. Coastal residents prepared for the storm and grocery stores reported a steady demand for hurricane staples: bottled water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows.\\nIntroduction:\\nHurricane Chantal, the first of the season, aimed for the Texas and Louisiana \\ncoasts Monday, a day in which the storm\\'s winds capsized an oil drilling work \\nvessel and trapped as many as 10 crew members inside. \\n\\nThree of the crewmen were picked up by a nearby fishing vessel and a fourth was \\nplucked from the water by a Coast Guard helicopter. The Coast Guard also said \\nthere were unconfirmed reports that two others had been picked up by another \\nboat. \\n\\nRescue divers, however, were unable to search the overturned service vessel for \\nsurvivors because of increasingly strong winds and high waves. The hope was \\nthat at least some of the crew would be in airtight cabins with enough oxygen \\nto survive until help reached them. But Coast Guard Petty Officer Bob Morehead \\nsaid the search was called off in the late afternoon because winds were in \\nexcess of 60 m.p.h. and waves were at 12 feet and building. \\n\\nShortly thereafter, the National Hurricane Center in Miami announced that \\nChantal was blowing at more than 74 m.p.h., strong enough to move it into the \\nlowest hurricane classification, and the winds were later reported at 75 m.p.h. \\n\\nThe 72-foot service vessel, leased to the Chevron Corp. by the Avis Bourg Co., \\ncapsized about 25 miles south of Morgan City, La. It is a self-propelled vessel \\nwith legs that can be extended to the ocean floor. The boat was ordered into \\nport because of the impending storm. \\n\\nLate Monday afternoon, Chantal was about 200 miles south-southeast of \\nGalveston, Tex., traveling northwest at about 10 m.p.h. Officials at the \\nNational Hurricane Service in Miami said the storm was expected to reach land \\nsome time this afternoon or evening. \\n\\nThe best estimate Monday was that the center of the hurricane would hit the \\nwestern Louisiana or upper Texas coast. Hurricane warnings were issued from \\nFreeport, Tex., to Morgan City. Tropical storm warnings were issued as far \\nsouth as Port O\\'Connor, Tex., and as far east as Mobile, Ala. Bob Ebaugh, a \\nweather specialist at the hurricane center, said 10 to 15 inches of rain was \\nexpected in southern Mississippi, Louisiana and East Texas. \\n\\nMeanwhile, coastal residents began what has long been a ritual along the Gulf \\nCoast during hurricane season, which begins in late spring and runs through \\nearly fall. Grocery stores began reporting a steady demand for hurricane \\nstaples -- bottled water, batteries, canned goods and tape for windows. \\n\\nOne particular concern in Houston was the possibility of major flooding should \\nthe city be on the wet, or eastern, side of the hurricane. In that event, the \\nHouston area would have \"extensive flooding,\" said Bill Evans, flood watch \\ndirector for the Harris County Flood Control District. \\n\\nBesides heavy rains and wind, the hurricane is expected to cause tides 5 to 7 \\nfeet above normal. Chantal is the third named storm since the beginning of the \\nhurricane season June 1. Tropical Storm Allison dumped huge amounts of rain on \\nTexas and Louisiana in June, and Tropical Storm Barry dissipated in the \\nAtlantic without reaching land. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\n\\\\011 Henceforth, the World Bank will tie loan volume to efforts by a receiving country to fight poverty. This new emphasis will make the aim of alleviation of poverty a central objective by the bank in the 1990\\'s. The Bank said that poverty assessments by country will be available within two years. The assessments will allow the receiving country and the World Bank to collaborate in a joint effort at poverty reduction. The new directive rewards a government with larger loans for a stronger commitment to poverty reduction; a weaker commitment to poverty reduction will warrant less support.\\nIntroduction:\\nTHE World Bank will link loan volume to the strength of a country\\'s efforts\\nto fight poverty, according to an operational directive to staff issued\\ntoday by Mr Lewis Preston, the bank\\'s president.\\nThe link between loans and poverty relief forms part of a new drive to make\\npoverty alleviation the bank\\'s central mission in the 1990s.\\nThe shift in priorities is also reflected in a commitment to make\\ncomprehensive assessments of the nature and extent of poverty in the third\\nworld, allowing the bank to design more effective policies to fight poverty.\\nIn the directive, Mr Preston says poverty reduction is \\'the benchmark by\\nwhich our performance as a development institution will be measured\\'. He\\nadds that the new instructions to staff are intended to \\'ensure that these\\npolicies are fully reflected in the bank\\'s operations\\'.\\nThe bank is also publishing a handbook containing examples of past best\\npractice on poverty reduction.\\nThe bank says poverty assessments should be available for most developing\\ncountries within two years. These would form the basis for a \\'collaborative\\napproach to poverty reduction by country officials and the bank\\'.\\nThe directive signals an attempt to impose a form of \\'social conditionality\\'\\non borrowing countries. \\'Stronger government commitment to poverty reduction\\nwarrants greater support; conversely, weaker commitment to poverty reduction\\nwarrants less support,\\' it says.\\nMr Preston\\'s emphasis on poverty is a reaction to bank policies in the\\n1980s, when the aim was to improve economic efficiency in developing\\ncountries. The new directive says structural adjustment lending in the past\\ndecade \\'overshadowed the bank\\'s poverty reduction objectives\\'.\\nThe bank is also reacting to new evidence suggesting that the number of poor\\nin developing countries will rise during the 1990s, rather than stabilise as\\nhad been expected.\\nPoverty his judge, Page 34\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe earthquake in the Bay area on Tuesday had been targeted as likely to have one by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1998. The prediction was based on time elapse since the 1906 San Francisco quake, among other factors. The quake registered 6.9 on the Richter scale and was centered in the Santa Cruz, California, area. Reports indicated widespread damage, especially on highways and old masonry buildings. A quake of 7 on the Richter scale can cause major heavy damage. Some Southern California areas have an even higher probability of a major quake, the highest being Bakersfield in central California with a 90% probability.\\nIntroduction:\\n   The major earthquake that struck the San\\nFrancisco Bay area Tuesday occurred in a region seismologists\\ntargeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in\\nNorthern California.\\n   A 1988 report by the U.S. Geological Survey placed the\\nprobability of an earthquake of 6.5 magnitude on the Richter scale\\nat 30 percent by the year 2018 in the Southern Santa Cruz mountains.\\n   The high probability is based on several factors, including\\nlength of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in\\n1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at\\nthe California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.\\n   ``This is not to say we predicted the earthquake. It just has to\\ndo with the probability of an earthquake in this area,\\'\\' Allen said.\\n   He noted that the 1988 report, titled ``Probabilities of Large\\nEarthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault,\\'\\'\\npresented information that was already widely known among\\nscientists. Allen said this information should have alerted\\nofficials to take preventive steps.\\n   Frank Baldwin of U.S. Geological Survey\\'s Earthquake Center said\\nthe quake\\'s magnitude was 6.9 on the Richter scale. It was centered\\nin the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico.\\n   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on\\nseismographs.

The free marketers claim incumbent politicians have an unfair advantage, 95% of the incumbents were re-elected, and a citizen Congress would result in better government. Barro believes decreasing the excessive incentive of maintaining a legislator\\'s seniority status may be a better solution. Legislative branch term limits are an attempt to shift power back to the executive branch, now subjected to limits. Barro believes ending executive limits would be a better solution, especially since there is no evidence that they improved governing.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nTo economists, term limits sound like minimum wages, rent\\ncontrols and similar interferences with free markets. In each\\ncase, the government tries to prevent a mutually advantageous\\ntrade: an employer hiring a low-productivity, hence, low-wage\\nworker who is willing to work at that wage; a renter inducing\\nan increase in the supply of housing by willingly paying a\\nhigher price; and an electorate choosing a desired\\nrepresentative who is willing to serve. The real surprise is\\nthat some strong supporters of free markets, such as The Wall\\nStreet Journal, have been the biggest advocates of term\\nlimits. What is going on here?\\n\\nOne argument is that incumbent politicians have unfair\\nadvantages in elections because of their ready access to\\ncampaign funds, staff, mailing and travel privileges, media\\npublicity, and so on. Hence, the electorate is fooled\\nsystematically into supporting incumbents even when they are\\ninferior to their challengers. This argument is similar to\\nthe Galbraith-like view that big corporations with massive\\nadvertising budgets can consistently dupe their customers\\ninto buying inferior products. Supporters of free markets and\\nthe capitalistic system reject this message because they have\\nfaith in the self-interested consumer to discipline the\\ncompanies that do not deliver the goods. Advocates of the\\ndemocratic electoral process ought to have similar confidence\\nin the public.\\n\\nAnother argument is that a citizen Congress with its\\ncontinuing flow of fresh faces into Washington would result\\nin better government than that provided by representatives\\nwith lengthy tenure. The counter-argument is that experience\\nis an important characteristic for legislators. Each\\nviewpoint has some validity. Presumably the best solution is\\nto let the market decide, that is, to allow the electorate to\\ndetermine the proper balance between freshness and\\nexperience. Most of us would not want the government to\\ndetermine whether a familiar or a new brand of toothpaste is\\npreferable; why is a political representative different in\\nthis respect?\\n\\nMany commentators bemoan the high tendency for incumbents\\nto be re-elected. But if the electoral control process is\\nworking, so that officeholders conform with the interests of\\nthe majority of their constituents, then the electorate\\nrewards its representatives with re-election. If the public\\nvoted against satisfactory performers just to install a new\\nface, then officeholders would have less incentive to behave\\nand the system would work badly. Thus the main inference from\\na 95% re-election rate is that the political process is\\nworking and that officeholders are conforming to the wishes\\nof their constituents. If we ever see a 50% re-election rate,\\nthen there really would be reason to worry.\\n\\nThe threat not to re-elect works only if the incumbent is\\ninterested in another term, whether for his current or for\\nanother office. A problem with term limits is that it creates\\nmore lame ducks, who are less responsive to the desires of\\nthe electorate. Much has been made of Alexander Hamilton\\'s\\nreflections on this point in Federalist 72: \"One ill effect\\nof the exclusion {from re-election} would be a diminution of\\nthe inducements to good behavior.\" (It is interesting to\\nnote, however, that Hamilton was not discussing term limits\\non the legislature, and was actually arguing against the term\\nlimits on the chief executive that are contained now in the\\n22nd Amendment.)\\n\\nThe only respectable argument in favor of term limits that\\nI know of refers to the legislature and involves the\\ninteraction with the seniority system. Representatives\\naccumulate more power as they become more senior, partly\\nbecause of better committee assignments and more staff and\\npartly because of increased familiarity with government\\nofficials and institutions and with outside interest groups.\\nSome aspects of this power, such as greater experience with\\ngovernmental programs, are desirable; others, such as the\\nincreased ability to extract funds from interest groups, are\\nnot.\\n\\nEven if seniority is a net cost in the aggregate, however,\\neach district has an incentive to re-elect its own incumbent\\n(and would if possible vote against the incumbents from other\\ndistricts) because the representative\\'s relative seniority\\ntranslates into a large share of governmental largess. The\\nvoters would be better off if they could reach a binding\\nagreement that precluded the re-election of incumbents, that\\nis, if term limits were instituted. As an example, the voters\\nof Washington state recently rejected a proposal that would\\nhave limited the seniority of their congressional\\nrepresentatives relative to those of other states. Yet the\\nsame voters likely would have approved a proposal that\\nlimited the terms of all Congressional representatives, not\\njust those from Washington.\\n\\nChanges in the seniority system may therefore be a\\nsuperior alternative to term limits. If a representative\\'s\\npower to favor his or her district did not vary with\\nseniority, then voters would not have an excessive incentive\\nto re-elect incumbents. The seniority system could be changed\\nonly by getting Congress to alter its own rules (as it has at\\ntimes in the past) or else by constitutional amendment, which\\nwould, from a practical standpoint, also have to initiate in\\nCongress. Although the chances of success seem small, one way\\nto proceed would be to call the proposal the Civil Rights\\nAmendment -- recent experience shows that calling something a\\nCivil Rights Act helps to get it passed. It does not seem to\\nmatter much -- it may even be detrimental -- if the content\\nof a Civil Rights Act actually has something to do with civil\\nrights.\\n\\nThe weakening of the seniority system in Congress would,\\nit must be conceded, sacrifice some genuine benefits. Greater\\nexperience may justify positions of more authority, and, the\\nrewards from seniority give Congress an efficient method to\\nmotivate good behavior from junior members. These arguments\\nparallel the benefits from worker seniority in firms (or,\\nindeed, the usefulness of a parole system as a carrot to help\\ncontrol inmates in prisons). The formal system of seniority\\nis also only a part of the story; members\\' increasing\\nfamiliarity with interest groups is a kind of seniority that\\nwould not be eliminated by changes in the rules for committee\\nassignments, staffing and so on. It is unrealistic as well as\\nundesirable to try to remove completely the operation of a\\nseniority system in any legislature.\\n\\nThe various complexities about legislative term limits and\\ntheir interaction with seniority do not arise for executive\\nterm limits. Voters do not have to worry that rejecting their\\nincumbent puts them at a disadvantage relative to other\\nvoters\\' incumbents, so the electorate can properly weigh\\nexperience, fresh ideas, the value of rewarding satisfactory\\nperformance in office, and so on. The only defense for\\nexecutive term limits is that the electorate needs to be\\nprotected against itself, an argument which, if true, would\\nmean that democracy was seriously flawed and would work much\\nless well than it seems to.\\n\\nOf course, since the passage of the 22nd Amendment in\\n1951, there is a two-term limit on the presidency, and 29 of\\nthe 50 states have some kind of term limit on the governor.\\n(Seven of these limits have been introduced since 1960.)\\n\\nThe origins of these limits may have more to do with\\ncompetition between legislative and executive branches than\\nwith a desire to improve public policy. The 22nd Amendment\\nreflected Congress\\'s desire to shift the balance of power\\naway from the executive, and notably the desire of a\\nRepublican-dominated House and Senate to prevent the rise of\\nanother powerful Democratic president like Franklin\\nRoosevelt. To some extent, the current pressures for\\nlegislative term limits reflect the reverse desire to shift\\npower away from Congress. From the standpoint of balance of\\npower, it would surely be preferable to repeal the 22nd\\nAmendment.\\n\\nPerhaps the best test of executive term limits is to check\\nwhether the states with term limits on the governor have\\nperformed better or worse than those without such limits. The\\nanswer, if one holds constant geographical region and the\\nlevel of per capita income in 1960, is that states with term\\nlimits experienced slightly below average growth of\\nper-capita income over the last 30 years but were also a\\nlittle below average in the fraction of state product that\\nwent to state and local government expenditures. Not\\nsurprisingly, the main message is that executive term limits\\nare not an important determinant of economic growth or state\\nspending.\\n\\nExecutive term limits are therefore a bad idea, but one\\nshould not expect vastly better performance at the state or\\nnational level from the elimination of these restrictions.\\nLegislative term limits are less clear-cut and it is possible\\nto build a respectable case that favors such limits. But it\\nis unrealistic to think that the enactment of these limits\\nwould lead to great improvements in the functioning of\\ngovernment and hence, in the performance of the economy.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nIn 1988 the nation\\'s more than 700 tornadoes caused 32 deaths, down from 59 a year earlier and the long-term average of 99.

Miss Taylor has been treated for pneumonia and has been hospitalized for 5 weeks. It has inspired a raft of rumors and handed up a field day for the tabloids. Partly because of gossip, Miss Taylor\\'s doctors at St. John\\'s Hospital in Santa Monica called a press conference. No AIDS, they said. No cancer. For the tabloid press has been humming with rumors that Liz Taylor had AIDS.\\nIntroduction:\\nHer movies now are few and far between, but when she is ill, the world still \\nstands at attention. Liz Taylor\\'s latest bout with pneumonia has drawn the kind \\nof intense scrutiny normally accorded presidential polyps. It has inspired a \\nraft of rumors and handed up a field day for the giddy tabloids. And today, yet \\nagain, everyone is talking about La Liz. \\n\\nBut then Liz Taylor, 58, has always lived a life of extremes. If she has \\nenjoyed the most brilliant career and the glare of fame, she has also survived \\nseven rocky marriages to six men, the frailest health and the most frightening \\nbouts with addiction to booze, drugs and food. And through it all, there have \\nbeen armies of press recording each divorce, each hospital stay. \\n\\nIt was partly to still the gossips that Taylor\\'s doctors called a press \\nconference Wednesday at St. John\\'s Hospital and Medical Center in Santa Monica. \\nNo AIDS, they said. No cancer. For the tabloid press had been humming with \\nrumors that Liz Taylor had AIDS virtually since she was checked into Daniel \\nFreeman Hospital in Marina del Rey April 9 with a high fever and sinus \\ninfection. \\n\\nAnd when Taylor\\'s publicists first issued flat denials, the press went on to \\nspeculate about the speculation. Did the AIDS rumors start because of Taylor\\'s \\nballyhooed friendship with publishing titan Malcolm Forbes, whose recent death \\ntouched off reports about his alleged homosexuality? Or was it because of her \\nreputation as a major fund-raiser for the disease? Or because one of her \\ndoctors, Michael Roth, was a renowned AIDS specialist -- even though Roth was \\nsupervising her treatment for drug and alcohol addiction as early as 1983? \\n\\n\"Liz is a national treasure and when she entered the hospital, I thought it was \\nas important as the President of the U.S. going in and we treated it as such. \\nLiz is as close to American royalty as you can have, and our readers . . . in \\nthe heartland . . . they\\'re living and dying with her,\" said Barry Levine, \\nHollywood bureau chief of the Star, which featured a cover photograph of Liz, \\nhooked up to an intravenous tube and oxygen mask, being transferred from the \\nMarina del Rey hospital to St. John\\'s. Levine declined comment on a rumor \\ncirculating among reporters that the tabloid had paid $50,000 for the pictures. \\n\\nSome press coverage has bent over backwards to tug at the bounds of \\ncredibility; the National Enquirer has Liz communing with the ghosts of Forbes \\nand one-time husband Richard Burton. \\n\\nIn all, Liz\\'s current illness has drawn the most attention yet, according to \\nher publicist, Chen Sam. More than 100 reporters, photographers and cameramen \\nconverged on St. John\\'s, many of whom had flown in from around the country for \\nthe 15-minute press conference. Behind a chorus line of video cameras -- \\nrepresenting the major networks, the local stations, CNN and the tabloid shows \\n-- reporters peppered the doctors with pointed and sometimes testy questions \\nabout Taylor\\'s treatment and drug use. \\n\\n\"I heard some guys talking behind me, saying, \\'I can\\'t believe they\\'re hounding \\nher like this.\\' I felt like saying, \\'Are you offended reading about her?\\' \" \\nsniffed Val Richardson, a reporter from the Washington Times who\\'d flown in \\nthat morning. \\n\\nAt any rate, the news was good. Taylor was off a respirator and breathing with \\nthe help of an oxygen mask. She had apparently rebounded from a bad weekend, \\nwhen doctors feared she might die. Although Taylor\\'s physicians are still \\ntrying to identify the virus, they are treating her for pneumonia with \\nantibiotics. And she remains in the intensive-care unit, but she continues to \\nimprove and is expected to move to a regular room this weekend, Sam said \\nThursday. \\n\\nMeanwhile, her own security guards keep watch over her private room in \\nintensive care. She has received her four children -- Christopher and Michael \\nWilding, Maria Burton-Carson and Liza Todd-Tivey -- friends Roddy McDowall and \\nCarole Bayer Sager and Liz\\'s younger, ex-trucker boyfriend, Larry Lee \\nFortensky, 38. \\n\\n\"I saw her yesterday and I was really pleased,\" Sager said Wednesday. \"I \\nthought her color was good. She couldn\\'t speak because she had the respirator. \\nHer eyes were clear and she definitely understood what I said and motioned, \\nmade me know she understood.\" \\n\\nIf Liz\\'s public is fascinated by her frailties, perhaps reassured somehow by \\nthe knowledge that even the gods are vulnerable, their interest is also piqued \\nby the public face she puts on her relentless brushes with illness and \\naddiction. The Taylor wit shone through even Wednesday\\'s press conference, when \\ndoctors passed on the actress\\' desire to \"come out and wave at you, but she \\nwasn\\'t in her balcony attire.\" \"I think she\\'s extraordinarily brave,\" Sager \\nsaid. \"She just has an enormous reservoir of inner strength that she calls on \\nwhen she has to. All of us were encouraged and optimistic.\" \\n\\nShe has needed it. Taylor\\'s respiratory ailments alone have been a recurring \\nproblem. Bronchitis and laryngitis brought down the curtain on numerous \\nperformances of \"The Little Foxes,\" which Taylor starred in on Broadway in \\n1981, and Noel Coward\\'s \"Private Lives,\" which toured the country in 1983. The \\ncancellations prompted the play\\'s co-producer, Zev Bufman, to declare, \\n\"Bronchitis has plagued Elizabeth all her life.\" \\n\\nIn fact, Taylor has been plagued by health woes ever since her 1945 film debut \\nin \"National Velvet\"; her fall from a horse triggered a lifetime of back \\ntrouble. And when Taylor retired from films to marry the Republican senator \\nfrom Virginia, John Warner, her well-being continued to make headlines; she \\nchoked on a chicken bone and wrenched her back after slipping on a carpet at a \\nreception honoring former President Gerald R. Ford. Over the years she has \\nendured about 20 major operations on her back, appendix, eyes and teeth; when \\nthe Asian flu threatened Taylor\\'s life, doctors made a hole in her throat so \\nshe could breathe. \\n\\nBut it has been her wrestling matches with weight and addiction that have \\nconsistently lured the world\\'s curiosity and, at times, admiration. Taylor\\'s \\nunhappy stint as a politician\\'s wife prompted her weight to balloon to 180 \\npounds. When she emerged a born-again beauty in 1985 after shedding 60 pounds, \\nand wrote a beauty book to boot, she was applauded by many -- including \\ncomedian Joan Rivers, who had made fat-Liz jokes the mainstay of her act. \\n\\n\"For somebody like me who is obsessive, it\\'s amazing I was never a gambler,\" \\nshe said at the time. \"I could have become anorexic. I got to a size 4 and \\nsaid, \\'Why not a size 2?\\' Then I slapped myself and went from 118 to 122, which \\nis the right weight for me.\" \\n\\nBut her battles against addiction have played havoc with her fight against the \\nbulge. And her persistent back problems have nurtured her dependence on pills. \\nHer addictions have even been linked to a criminal investigation by the Los \\nAngeles County district attorney\\'s office; last week, prosecutors announced \\nthat no charges would be filed against Taylor\\'s doctors, who had been accused \\nof over-prescribing dependence-forming drugs. \\n\\nTaylor, the first celebrity known to enter the Betty Ford clinic in Rancho \\nMirage, made a public example of her willingness to take on her addictions in \\ntwo heavily publicized stays there. \\n\\nWhen Taylor first checked in, in 1983, she admitted to 35 years of addiction to \\npain killers and sleeping pills. She kept a diary that poignantly described \\nthat stay as \"probably the first time since I was 9 that nobody\\'s wanted to \\nexploit me. Now the bad news. I feel like hell. I\\'m going through withdrawal. \\nMy heart feels big and pounding. I can feel the blood rush through my body. I \\ncan almost see it, running like red water over the boulders in my pain-filled \\nneck and shoulders, then through my ears and into my pounding head. My eyelids \\nflutter. Oh God, I am so, so tired.\" \\n\\nBut the Betty Ford clinic encouraged Taylor only to fight the good fights that \\nhad brought her there, rather than take on all addictions -- to drugs and food \\n-- at once. And the late \\'80s had found Liz, hobbled by back pain, returning to \\nthose two sources of comfort. Taylor regained much of the weight, even though \\nshe took her drug problems in hand once again in a second stay at the Betty \\nFord clinic in 1988. \\n\\nBut through her ordeals, she has remained the same charmingly vain Liz who once \\ndeclared her hobbies to be clothes and jewels. She never budged from her room \\nat Betty Ford without her trademark darkened eyebrows. And even when she was \\nambushed recently by a Star photographer, Liz couldn\\'t help being, well, Liz. \\n\\nSays the Star\\'s Levine: \"No matter how sick she was, when someone down on the \\nground told her she was being photographed, she put on sunglasses, even though \\nshe had an IV in her arm, as if to cover herself up. Typical Liz Taylor. It was \\nsad and sweet, at the same time.\" \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nElizabeth has rallied from a near fatal bout with pneumonia but is \"not out of the woods,\" doctors say. \"I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and I believe that has now passed said Dr. Bernard Weintraub of St. Johns Hospital and Health Center.

The Second Amendment was originated by some of the states as protection against the federal government. The word \"people\" is used collectively and refers to a political entity such as a state. The Supreme Court on several occasions in the past has ruled that this amendment did not create a federally- protected right of individuals to bear arms but rather, limited the power of the federal government.\\nIntroduction:\\nThis is not an argument regarding the merits of gun control laws. \\n\\nSecond Amendment states (1791): \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to \\nthe security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, \\nshall not be infringed.\" As often happens in law, a simple English sentence may \\nhave legal significance which determines the application of the words. \\n\\nThe Second Amendment was, as was the rest of the first 10 amendments (the Bill \\nof Rights), insisted upon by some of the states for their own protection from \\nthe federal government. The Second Amendment stated one of the subjects about \\nwhich the federal government was prohibited from making any laws. The word \\n\"people\" as used in constitutional law is used collectively and refers to a \\npolitical entity, such as a state, and does not mean \"persons\" or individuals. \\n\\nAn early ruling in 1875 in U.S. vs. Cruikshank established the view of the U.S. \\nSupreme Court, upheld in cases in 1886, 1894 and 1939. The court in Cruikshank \\nsaid that the Second Amendment did not create a federally protected right of \\nindividuals but was an express limitation on the powers of the national \\n(federal) government. \\n\\nThere have been lower federal court decisions regarding the Second Amendment, \\nall supportive of this established principle. \\n\\nThe status of the Second Amendment as a constitutional issue is and has been \\nfor nearly 200 years: \\n\\n1) A restriction on the power of the federal government to limit or deny the \\nstates the right to have state militia. \\n\\n2) Not a federally protected right of individuals. \\n\\nThere is no national document controlling the states with regard to arms. The \\nstates may regulate arms within their borders. \\n\\nWILLIAM NEALY \\n\\nStudio City \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe author of an article in the Wall Street Journal believes that opponents of gun control write passionately but do not read well.

Other writers accuse him of distorting the Second Amendment on the \"..right to keep and bear arms\". The author simply maintains that the Amendment is not a barrier to gun control.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nOpponents of any sort of gun control write passionately,\\nbut, judging from their letters (\"Smile When You Say Gun\\nControl,\" Jan. 14), they don\\'t read well.\\n\\nFor example, one letter writer, commenting on my Dec. 12\\nCounterpoint, \"Gun Control Is Constitutional,\" felt compelled\\nto instruct me that the word militia means \"the whole\\npeople,\" a point I quoted three times and also paraphrased\\nonce in my brief article. He and the others who dwelt on this\\npoint also don\\'t read the Second Amendment very well. The\\nsubject is not just the militia but \"a well-regulated\\nmilitia,\" people trained, disciplined and armed for defense\\nof the community under commanding officers.\\n\\nThat same correspondent accused me of calling for \"removal\\nof all guns from American citizens through the implementation\\nof total regulations.\" I said nothing like that. I said that\\nalthough the Second Amendment has nothing to do with private\\nuses of arms, there is an unenumerated but undeniable right\\nto own a gun.\\n\\nWe have many rights not enumerated in the Constitution,\\nsuch as the right to marry, drive a car or own a dog. These\\nrights are not denied just because the Constitution doesn\\'t\\nmention them; and the rights are not disparaged by the fact\\nthat we must obtain a marriage license, driver\\'s license or a\\ndog license.\\n\\nIn the same way, the right to own a gun is not disparaged\\nby being licensed or otherwise regulated and controlled. One\\nletter writer who also knows something about the\\nConstitution, though disagreeing with me on another point,\\nagreed on the central issue, that regulation of gun ownership\\nand use does not violate the Constitution.\\n\\nAll the letters missed entirely my point about requiring\\ngun owners to \"sign up\" with (not \"join\") the National Guard.\\nI likened it to the current law requiring 18-year-old men to\\nregister with the Selective Service. Registering is very\\ndifferent from enlisting for active service. Requiring gun\\nowners to register with the National Guard would provide the\\nkind of scrutiny the Brady and Staggers bills contemplated,\\nand, if Congress dared, could provide an additional measure\\nof control over who owns what kinds of weapons.\\n\\nBut my main point was to show how far Congress can go in\\ngun-control legislation without exceeding its constitutional\\npowers, using as a model the legislation of the Second\\nCongress, which included most of the authors of the Second\\nAmendment.\\n\\nAnother letter writer thinks I have confused the issue by\\ncalling the duty to serve in the militia a right to serve,\\nbut if he will look at the debates in the First Congress he\\nwill see that there is no confusion at all, that the authors\\nof the Second Amendment were talking about the right to\\nserve. Consistent with all of the Bill of Rights, its subject\\nis rights, not duties. Elbridge Gerry opposed James Madison\\'s\\nclause exempting persons \"religiously scrupulous,\" because of\\nthe danger that it might be abused to discriminate against\\nmembers of certain sects, \"to declare who are those who are\\nreligiously scrupulous,\" and then keep them out of the\\nmilitia.\\n\\nThe real issue is that the Second Amendment addressed a\\nserious public concern, to protect the right of citizens to\\nserve as defenders of the community in times of peril, not\\nthe personal uses of guns. And since the proliferation of\\nguns in the hands of criminals has become a national\\ncalamity, as police officials all over the nation attest, it\\nis essential that we recapture the true purpose of the Second\\nAmendment. Plain and simple, it is no barrier to sensible gun\\ncontrol.\\n\\nRobert A. Goldwin\\n\\nResident Scholar\\n\\nAmerican Enterprise Institute\\n\\nWashington\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe gun control movement in the U.S. sprouted from Roger B. Taney, the racist chief justice of the U.S. and author of the Dred Scott decision of 1857. Dred Scott was a slave who sued for his freedom. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. Chief Justice Taney ruled against Scott, saying that a slave was not a citizen and therefore of no standing in court. The decision by Taney was eventually carried over into the context of the Second Amendment due to the racial paranoia about black men with guns. This paranoia resulted in restrictions being placed on gun ownership.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nWhat irony. Most black leaders (as distinct from\\nrank-and-file blacks) are supporters, at least in public, of\\nthe gun control -- really, prohibition -- movement. Do they\\nrealize that America\\'s gun-control movement sprouted from the\\nsoil of Roger B. Taney, the racist chief justice who wrote\\nthe infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857?\\n\\nIn the early part of the 19th century, Dred Scott, a black\\nslave, had been taken by his owner from Missouri, a slave\\nstate, to Illinois, a free state. From there he was taken\\ninto the Wisconsin territory, free territory above the 36 30\\'\\nlatitude of the Missouri Compromise. After living in free\\nterritory for a while, he returned with his owner to\\nMissouri.\\n\\nWhen his owner died in 1846, Scott sued in the state\\ncourts of Missouri for his freedom, on the ground that he had\\nlived in free territory. He won his case, but it was reversed\\nin the Missouri Supreme Court. Scott appealed to the federal\\ncourts, since the person he was actually suing, John Sanford,\\nthe executor of the estate that owned Scott, lived in New\\nYork.\\n\\nIt was in that setting that Chief Justice Taney made his\\ninfamous rulings:\\n\\n1. That black people, whether free or slave, were not\\ncitizens of the U.S.; therefore, they had no standing in\\ncourt.\\n\\n2. Scott was denied freedom.\\n\\n3. The Missouri Compromise was ruled unconstitutional.\\n\\nWell known to most students of race relations is the\\nformer attorney general and secretary of the Treasury\\'s\\npre-civil war dictum that black people \"being of an inferior\\norder\" had \"no right which any white man was bound to\\nrespect.\" Much less known are his equally racist\\npronouncements denying black people, whether slave or free,\\nspecific constitutional protections enjoyed by whites.\\n\\nIn Dred Scott Chief Justice Taney, writing for the court\\'s\\nmajority, stated that if blacks were \"entitled to the\\nprivileges and immunities of citizens, . . . {i}t would give\\npersons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in\\nany one state of the union, the right . . . to keep and carry\\narms wherever they went. And all of this would be done in the\\nface of the subject race of the same color, both free and\\nslaves, and inevitably producing discontent and\\ninsubordination among them, and endangering the peace and\\nsafety of the state. . . .\"\\n\\nAlthough much of Justice Taney\\'s overtly racist legal\\nreasoning was repudiated by events that followed -- such as\\nthe Civil War and Reconstruction -- the subliminal effects\\nwere felt throughout that era. In the post-Reconstruction\\nperiod, when the pendulum swung back to overt racism, Justice\\nTaney\\'s philosophy resurfaced. It was during this period that\\nracial paranoia about black men with guns intensified. It was\\npotent enough to cause the infringement on the Second\\nAmendment to the Constitution\\'s \"right . . . to keep and bear\\narms.\"\\n\\nUnder natural law, a freeman\\'s right to obtain and\\nmaintain the implements of self-defense has always been\\nsacred. This right was restricted or prohibited for serfs,\\npeasants and slaves. Gun control was never an issue in\\nAmerica until after the Civil War when black slaves were\\nfreed.\\n\\nIt was this change in the status of the black man, from\\nslave to freeman, that caused racist elements in the country\\n(North and South) to agitate for restrictions on guns --\\nignoring long established customs and understanding of the\\nSecond Amendment. The specter of a black man with rights of a\\nfreeman, bearing arms, was too much for the early heirs of\\nRoger Taney to bear.\\n\\nThe 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, along\\nwith the various Reconstruction civil rights acts, prevented\\ngun prohibitionists from making laws that were explicitly\\nracist and that would overtly deny black people the right to\\nbear arms. The end of Reconstruction signaled the return of\\nTaneyism -- overtly among the masses and covertly on the\\nSupreme Court. Gun-control legislation of the late 19th and\\nearly 20th centuries, enacted at the state and local levels,\\nwere implicitly racist in conception. And in operation, those\\nlaws invidiously targeted blacks.\\n\\nWith the influx of large numbers of Irish, Italian and\\nJewish immigrants into the country, gun laws now also\\ntargeted whites from the underprivileged classes of\\nimmigrants. Eventually these oppressive gun laws were\\nextended to affect all but a privileged few. Throughout the\\nhistory of New York state\\'s Sullivan law, enacted at the\\nstart of the 20th century, mainly the rich and powerful have\\nhad easy access to licenses to carry handguns. Some of the\\nnotables who have received that privilege include Eleanor\\nRoosevelt, John Lindsay, Donald Trump, Arthur Sulzberger,\\nJoan Rivers and disk jockey Howard Stern.\\n\\nOf the 27,000 handgun carry permits in New York City,\\nfewer than 2% are issued to blacks -- who live and work in\\nhigh-crime areas and really are in need of protection.\\n\\nAnd what of the origins of the National Rifle Association,\\nwhich is wrongly viewed as a racist organization by the black\\nsupporters of gun prohibition? It was inspired and organized\\nby Union Army officers after the Civil War.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nBecause of a flood of diamonds from Angola and diamond \"leaks\" outside Russia\\'s contract with the cartel, De Beers imposed quotas on producers and is operating its newest mine below capacity. Venetia came into production in July 1992 at a cost of $400 million. It gives De Beers direct control over more than 50% of the world\\'s gem diamond output and a powerful negotiating position within the cartel. The mine employs fewer people than in the past because of highly automated processing and fewer overseers. It busses in workers from their home towns for 12-hour shifts instead of using migrant workers.\\nIntroduction:\\nTurbulence in the global diamond markets is being felt even here at Venetia,\\nDe Beers\\' newest diamond mine, 30km from South Africa\\'s borders with\\nBotswana and Zimbabwe.\\nOnly weeks before the mine came into production in July 1992 at a cost of\\nUSDollars 400m, De Beers\\' Central Selling Organisation, which controls 80\\nper cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, imposed quotas on its\\nproducer-suppliers because of a flood of gem stones from Angola. For a time\\nVenetia, the first mine of any sort in South Africa to gain permission for\\nseven-day working, moved to a five-day week.\\nThis year it has gone back to seven-day working as the quotas were eased so\\nthat the CSO is now accepting 85 per cent of the diamonds it contracted to\\ntake from producers. However, there is still turmoil in the diamond market,\\ncaused by uncertainty about Russian exports following \\'leaks\\' of stones from\\nthat country outside its contract with the CSO.\\nConsequently, Mr Hans Gastrow, general manager, says that this year Venetia\\nwill process 4.3m tonnes of ore, 6.5 per cent below its capacity. It is also\\nmining an area of lower grade ore, which has fewer diamonds in each tonne.\\nMr Gastrow is giving no forecasts but all this implies that output will be\\nwell below the 5.6m carats a year De Beers predicted Venetia would yield at\\nfull production.\\nLast year the mine, building up rapidly, more than doubled output and\\nprocessed 3.6m tonnes of ore to recover 4.96m carats. About 70 per cent of\\nVenetia\\'s diamonds are of gem quality and analysts suggest that at Dollars\\n100 a carat on average the mine is generating annual sales of about Dollars\\n500m.\\nMr Gastrow says that, apart from the imposition of the CSO quota, Venetia\\n\\'has made a remarkably smooth transition from construction to production\\'.\\nThis year will be a time of consolidation.\\nHe insists that the quota is having no impact on employment. Nevertheless,\\nVenetia originally was to have employed 870 and it now has 764. A mine of\\nVenetia\\'s size in the past would have employed 2,000. The total has been\\nkept down here partly by highly automated process plant but also by \\'fewer\\npeople employed just to see that other people are doing their jobs\\',\\naccording to Mr David Gadd-Claxton, ore extraction manager.\\nVenetia was the first new South African diamond mine for 25 years. It is\\nalso the country\\'s biggest diamond mine and a major contributor of export\\nearnings.\\nThe mine has also revitalised De Beers\\' production, as it is accounting for\\nhalf the group\\'s output in South Africa and replacing production from its\\n100-year-old Kimberley mines, which are now fading away.\\nVenetia\\'s success is strategically important to De Beers because, when its\\noutput is added to that in Botswana and Namibia, it gives the group direct\\ncontrol over more than 50 per cent of world rough gem diamond output. This\\nprovides a major base for the CSO to work from and gives it a powerful\\nposition from which to negotiate with other producers in the diamond cartel.\\nAnd, while Venetia is using conventional methods to mine about 500m tonnes\\nof waste and to mine and process 100m tonnes of ore over its projected\\n23-year life, it is trying some highly innovative ideas about labour\\nrelations and environmental issues, at least as far as South Africa is\\nconcerned.\\nFor example, there are no migrant workers at the mine. Employees are bussed\\nin from nearby towns for 12-hour shifts and then return to their families.\\nVenetia is also breaking with the De Beers\\' tradition that, for security\\nreasons, no equipment leaves the mine but is burried within the top security\\narea once it is no longer useful. Here worn out equipment will be stockpiled\\nand sold off when the mine closes. It could be worth millions of dollars.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe city of Santa Barbara, California has introduced the idea of fire-resistant garden landscaping--firescaping--to help homeowners improve the chances of their property surviving brush fires. The garden is landscaped into four plant zones with the most flammable in Zone 4, farthest from the house. Zone 3 plants have low profile and slow- burning characteristics. Zone 2 features highly fire-retardant succulents, acting as a greenbelt zone of maximum protection. Zone 1, closest to the residence, is a small area of plants that pose little risk of burning. Xeriscaping, landscaping with drought-tolerant native plants, is also becoming commonplace.\\nIntroduction:\\nMost Southern Californians would agree that hills and canyons are among the \\nmost desirable places to live. But these wild, yet settled, places at the edge \\nof the metropolis -- what botanists sometimes call \"the urban-chaparral \\ninterface\" -- are the properties most threatened by wildfire. \\n\\nWhile little can be done to control the natural fires that occur in chaparral \\ncountry, homeowners can change their approach to landscaping and help improve \\nthe chances of their homes and property surviving a brush fire. \\n\\n\"The idea behind fire-resistant landscaping -- firescaping -- is to design \\nlandscaping to minimize the fire hazard,\" says Owen Dell, a Santa Barbara \\nlandscape contractor who has many canyon and hillside homeowners as clients. \\n\\nDell became interested in the concept after the 1977 Sycamore Canyon fire in \\nwhich 200 homes were lost and only a shift in the wind prevented the loss of \\nadditional Santa Barbara residences. After the fire, Dell began studying its \\neffects. \"Many of my clients lost property, but the fire jumped from house to \\nhouse, then skipped others. I realized that the landscaping had a relationship \\nto the amount of devastation.\" \\n\\nDell, the Santa Barbara City Fire Department, the city government and a number \\nof volunteers combined their efforts and began planning the Santa Barbara \\nFirescapes Demonstration Garden to educate the public about reducing the risks \\nof wildfire near their homes. \\n\\nThe concept behind the garden is that while no plant is fireproof, some are \\nmore flammable than others. The garden is a model of how to design and maintain \\nlandscaping around the home to provide a line of defense against fire. \\n\\nThe garden is landscaped into four plant zones, with the most flammable \\nvegetation planted farthest from the house. Zone 4, farthest from the house, \\nconsists of native vegetation that has been thinned to reduce the amount of \\nfuel that could feed a fire. Native chaparral flora, including oaks, ceanothus \\nand manzanita, are found here. \\n\\nZone 3 includes plants selected for their low profile and slow-burning \\ncharacteristics. Wildflowers such as Pacific Coast iris, monkeyflower and \\nCalifornia poppies add a splash of color to this zone. \\n\\nZone 2 features highly fire-retardant succulents. It\\'s designed to be a \\ngreenbelt zone of maximum fire protection. Jade, aloe vera, phormium and \\nevergreen currant are among the high-moisture-content plants characteristic of \\nthis zone. \\n\\nZone 1, closest to the residence, is a small area of plants that pose little \\nrisk of burning. Cactus, tobira and shiny leaf jasmine are examples of \\nfire-resistant plants that still have a high aesthetic appeal. \\n\\nSome trees and plants are surprisingly hazardous. \"Those eucalyptus trees,\" \\nDell says. \"If one of those lights up near your house, there\\'s no way to save \\nit. And the Monterey pine -- it\\'s so full of volatile oils, it\\'s almost \\nunbelievable.\" \\n\\nOne popular plant found almost everywhere in Southern California -- ice plant \\n-- would seem to be an ideal choice for a firescape garden. Actually, it can be \\na menace. The plant produces a great deal of litter beneath that succulent \\nsurface and can smolder for days. Two other surprisingly flammable flora are \\nredwood trees and bougainvillea. \\n\\nDell thinks several successive drought years have finally persuaded Southern \\nCalifornians to rethink approaches to gardening. Suddenly, xeriscaping -- \\nlandscaping with drought-tolerant natives -- is becoming commonplace and \\nfashionable. As Dell sees it, while many home gardeners have learned to deal \\nwith low-water conditions, they\\'ve virtually ignored another common Southern \\nCalifornia occurrence -- wildfire. \\n\\nJust as appropriate landscaping can help gardeners with water shortages, so may \\ncareful landscaping help reduce the risk of significant property damage in the \\nmost fire-prone areas. \\n\\nThe Firescapes Demonstration Garden is located across the street from City Fire \\nStation 7 at 2411 Stanwood Drive and is open every day from 8 a.m. until \\nsunset. A brochure available at the garden aids your exploration. For \\nadditional information, contact the Santa Barbara City Fire Department public \\neducation coordinator at (805) 564-5703. \\n\\nTo reach the garden: From U.S. 101 in Santa Barbara, exit on Salinas Street and \\ncontinue to a five-way intersection. Bear right (north) on Sycamore Canyon Road \\n(144) to Stanwood Drive (192). Turn left and continue to the fire station, on \\nyour left, just opposite the garden. There\\'s ample parking at the station, \\nwhich is located on the corner of Stanwood Drive and Mission Ridge Road. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nCalm waters of Prince William Sound stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in US history. The spill of 11.3M gallons occurred when the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef 25 miles from Valdez, Alaska. Exxon officials planned to pump oil remaining on the Valdez onto another Exxon tanker. A spill of this size in a complex environment promises to be a cleanup nightmare. The Valdez had been loaded at the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. with crude from the Trans-Alaska pipeline. Alyeska must now operate at reduced rate and its capacity would allow nine days of operation before it would shut down. Valdez relies on fishing, oil, and tourism.\\nIntroduction:\\n   The calm waters of Prince William Sound\\nhave stymied efforts to disperse the largest oil spill in U.S.\\nhistory, which spewed from a ship that ran aground trying to avoid\\nchunks of ice, officials said.\\n   The spill of some 270,000 barrels _ or 11.3 million gallons _\\noccurred early Friday when the 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez went\\nhard aground on Bligh Reef, about 25 miles outside Valdez, the\\nnorthermost ice-free port in the United States.\\n   Coast Guard spokesman Ed Wieliczkiewicz said the use of\\nchemicals to disperse and sink the heavy North Slope crude oil\\nfailed because the agents depend in part on rough seas to break up\\nthe oil.\\n   He said Exxon officials plan to pump the oil remaining aboard\\nthe Exxon Valdez onto the Exxon Baton Rouge, another tanker.\\n   Early Friday the Exxon Valdez was losing 20,000 gallons of oil\\nper hour, but the flow slowed to a trickle later.\\n   An oil slick snaked about five miles from the ship as wind and\\ntide pushed the crude oil into the sound and away from shore.\\n   ``This is the largest oil spill in U.S. history and it\\nunfortunately took place in an enclosed water body with numerous\\nislands, channels, bays and fiords,\\'\\' said Richard Golob, publisher\\nof the Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin.\\n   Gov. Steve Cowper said the ship was ``impaled on the reef.\\'\\' He\\nsaid the vessel steered from its course to avoid chunks of ice and\\ndid not return to its normal traffic lane.\\n   Dan Lawn, an engineer for the state Department of Environmental\\nConservation, said the captain could not steer the Exxon Valdez\\nback on course in time to avoid a collision.\\n   Lawn likened the ship\\'s situation to ``trying to park a Cadillac\\nin a Volkswagen spot.\\'\\'\\n   Divers were to check the ship\\'s hull and their findings were to\\nbe used in making plans for the removal of crude oil still aboard\\nthe vessel.\\n   ``A spill of this size in such a complex environment promises to\\nbe a cleanup nightmare,\\'\\' said Golob, a Cambridge, Mass.-based\\nconsultant whose firm has studied oil spills and environmental\\ndisasters for 15 years.\\n   In Washington, Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein\\nsaid efforts had begun to evacuate waterfowl, sea otters and other\\nwildlife from the danger area.\\n   The Exxon Valdez had loaded 1.2 million barrels of oil at the\\nAlyeska Pipeline Service Co. marine terminal at Valdez and was en\\nroute to Long Beach, Calif., when it crunched onto the reef. The\\nship marks the second aniversary of its maiden voyage today.\\n   The terminal was closed early Friday to tanker traffic as\\nofficials tried to deal with the mammoth spill. The flow in the\\ntrans-Alaska oil pipeline also was reduced to 800,000 barrels daily\\nfrom 1.2 million barrels.\\n   Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan said that, at the reduced rate,\\nthe marine terminal\\'s capacity would allow nine days of operation\\nbefore the line would have to be shut down.\\n   Valdez, a town of about 3,000 year-round residents that grows to\\nmore than 4,000 with a summer influx of fishing industry workers\\nand travelers, is a picturesque community about 125 miles east of\\nAnchorage.\\n   It relies on the fishing, oil and tourism industries. The sound\\nis considered a playground for kayakers, sport fishermen and\\ntourists.\\n   Jason Wells, executive director of the Valdez Fisheries\\nDevelopment Association, said he believed the oil slick would cause\\nlittle damage unless wind pushes it back toward Valdez. The fishing\\nindustry is between seasons.\\n   Wells said the black cod fishery is scheduled to begin April 1,\\nbut the region\\'s major herring fishery is not expected to get under\\nway until mid-April.\\n   But the spill likely will draw increasing fire from\\nenvironmentalists sensitive about the trans-Alaska pipeline and\\nefforts to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil\\ndevelopment.\\n   ``It\\'s of concern for two reasons: one is the size of the spill\\nand that this is such a sensitive, very productive area,\\'\\' said\\nLisa Speer, senior staff scientist with the Natural Resources\\nDefense Council in New York.\\n   Valdez City Manager Doug Griffin said the 800-mile trans-Alaska\\npipeline which carries oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez and the\\nmarine terminal have an enviable environmental record.

Twenty passengers and a crew of five died as the plane nosedived to earth while traveling from Denver to Colorado Springs. This is the third crash of a United jet in three years. In July, 1988 a United DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa with 110 fatalities, after an engine broke apart in flight. In February, 1989, the cargo door on a United Boeing 747 opened in flight, ripping a hole in the fuselage. Nine people were killed. Wind shear is suspected in the latest crash.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nA United Airlines Boeing 737-200 jetliner carrying 25\\npassengers and crew members crashed into a dry lake area near\\nColorado Springs, Colo., municipal airport, apparently\\nkilling all aboard.\\n\\nAs National Transportation Safety Board investigators\\nhurried to the scene, there weren\\'t any early indications on\\nwhy the jet might have crashed. One focus of the inquiry,\\nhowever, is expected to center on whether there were unstable\\nor gusty winds at the time of the crash. The plane hit the\\nground several miles south of the airport at about 11:40 a.m.\\nEST yesterday, UAL Corp.\\'s United Airlines said. The plane\\nwas traveling from Denver.\\n\\nLocal news reporters quoted witnesses as saying that the\\nplane appeared to nosedive into the earth.\\n\\nThe crash comes at a particularly sensitive time for the\\ntravel industry. Although it has always been difficult to\\nmeasure the effect of crashes on travel, this accident comes\\njust as people were starting to get over fears of terrorism\\nrelated to the Persian Gulf war.\\n\\nAirlines have been slashing their flight schedules and\\nlaying off employees because of the downturn. Some travel\\nagencies have gone to four-day workweeks. Most of the travel\\nsector has resorted to sharp discounting to spark travel.\\n\\nThis, in fact, may have been one reason why the load on\\nthe United flight was light. The jet, which can hold at least\\n100 passengers, carried 20 passengers and a crew of two\\npilots and three flight attendants.\\n\\nYesterday\\'s marks the third crash of a United jet in the\\npast three years. In July 1988, a United DC-10 crashed in\\nSioux City, Iowa, after an engine broke apart in flight,\\nkilling 112 people. In February 1989, the cargo door on\\nUnited Boeing 747 burst open near Hawaii, tearing a gaping\\nhole in the fuselage. Nine passengers died.\\n\\nAbout two hours before yesterday\\'s crash, the National\\nWeather Service in Colorado Springs issued its first high\\nwind warning for the area since January, according to James\\nHall, a meteorological technician observer in Colorado\\nSprings.\\n\\nMoments after the crash, the average wind speed was 23\\nmiles per hour, gusting to 32 mph, Mr. Hall said. \"When it\\'s\\ngusty like that, the conditions are quite choppy. It would be\\nlike a turbulent river current. It\\'s essentially like water\\nhitting rocks and splashing and foaming over.\"\\n\\nA Federal Aviation Administration official said, \"There\\nwere some reports of gusting winds but whether or not that\\nhad any impact or whether there was any kind of mechanical\\nproblem, I can\\'t speculate.\"\\n\\nAnother FAA official said that although it is too early to\\npinpoint the cause, \"wind shear would be a major area of\\ninvestigation.\" If preliminary reports that there was wind\\nshear in the area are true, then \"that would indicate there\\nwas some instability in the atmosphere,\" he added.\\n\\nWind shear is a sudden, violent shift in wind direction.\\nIt can smash an airplane into the ground.\\n\\nHowever, he said that wind shear is most dangerous when an\\naircraft is flying at a very low altitude, either shortly\\nbefore landing or right after takeoff. In Sunday\\'s crash, the\\njetliner was a few miles from the airport and so should have\\nbeen at a somewhat higher altitude.\\n\\nThe last major U.S. wind shear accident occurred in Dallas\\nin 1985, when a Delta Air Lines jet crashed on approach.\\nSince then, the FAA and the industry have revamped pilot\\ntraining on wind shear and have devoted considerable\\nresources to dealing with the hazard.\\n\\nNo buildings or structures on the ground were damaged by\\nthe crash, according to the El Paso County Sheriffs\\nDepartment. An eight-year-old girl who was playing nearby,\\nwas treated for a head injury and released.\\n\\nThe jet involved in the crash is almost nine years old. It\\nwas delivered in May 1982 to now-defunct Frontier Airlines.\\nUnited acquired the plane in June 1986. The plane was\\noperated by an engine manufactured by United Technologies\\nCorp.\\'s Pratt &amp; Whitney division.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nA lightning-sparked fire in Utah\\'s Zion National Park spread out of control to 1,000 acres Tuesday, but rain helped firefighters hold the line on a 2,000-acre forest fire in Montana and two other major fires in Wyoming.

In parts of Africa, where AIDS has been a health risk, tuberculosis is running rampant. The combination of the two is catastrophic. Within the United States there has been a five percent increase in the number of reported cases, but the numbers vary widely from state to state. No new cases were reported in Wyoming for all of 1989. Newark, New Jersey saw a 35 percent increase in tuberculosis, and in New York City there has been a 150 percent increase among blacks.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Tuberculosis is alarming health officials again\\nbecause it\\'s posing new health threats with its connection to the\\nAIDS virus.\\n   A 35 percent increase in tuberculosis in 1989 in Newark, N.J.,\\nhas caught the attention of health officials, who had been\\npreviously recording with satisfaction a slow, steady decrease in\\nTB cases over the last few decades.\\n   They attribute the 5 percent national increase in TB cases in\\n1989 to the ravages of the AIDS virus, which destroys the body\\'s\\nimmune system and leaves victims open to TB infection, Dr. Philip\\nC. Hopewell of San Francisco General Hospital said Sunday.\\n   Hopewell and other health officials discussed the link between\\nAIDS and TB during the a four-day World Conference on Lung Health\\nin Boston, which ends Wednesday.\\n   About 4 percent of Americans identified as having the AIDS virus\\nalso have been diagnosed as being infected with tuberculosis, said\\nDr. Dixie E.

The American\\nLung Association estimates that 20,000 Americans a year develop TB.\\n   In parts of Africa, where AIDS is already a health risk,\\ntuberculosis has become epidemic, said Dr. Annik Rouillon,\\nexecutive director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis\\nand Lung Disease in Paris.\\n   ``The combination of the two is really catastrophic,\\'\\' she said.\\n   Snider stressed that tuberculosis, unlike AIDS, is a curable\\ndisease and called for TB screenings at drug rehabilitation\\nprograms, prisons or other places where AIDS tests are being\\nadministered.\\n   Snider also said doctors should administer TB tests to all\\npersons testing positive for the HIV virus since TB may not be\\nreadily diagnosed in AIDS patients.\\n   ``It\\'s important we get control of the situation,\\'\\' he said.\\n   In Wyoming, the Centers for Disease Control recorded no new\\ncases of TB in 1989, demonstrating that it is a condition that can\\nbe controlled and cured, according to Dr. Lee B.

Among the culprits are carbon monoxide (impairs judgement), microscopic carbon particles (lodges in the lungs), aldehydes (irritates air passages), and hydrocarbon-based substances (gene damage and cancer). Wildfire smoke also may accelerate aging, prompt fatal heart attacks, and trigger respiratory diseases (bronchitis or asthma). Overly heavy gear and inadequate filters are major problems. Developing protection has received little attention. Researchers have asked Congress to fund a $13.4 million study on health threat and respiratory protection.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe 80,000 men and women who battle the nation\\'s wildfires have always known \\ntheir lives were endangered by flames or heat or falling debris. \\n\\nBut now, two new studies show they also face an unseen hazard: Their health is \\nunder siege from the poisonous stew of gases and soot in wildfire smoke. \\n\\nAmong the culprits are carbon monoxide, which slows reaction and impairs \\njudgment; microscopic particles of carbon that lodge in the lungs; aldehydes \\nand acids that irritate air passages, and hydrocarbon-based substances and \\nother chemicals that can damage genes and cause cancer, tests show. \\n\\nWildland firefighters, whose only protection is the cotton bandanna covering \\ntheir faces, lose as much as 10% of their lung capacity after one routine \\nseason, and the damage persists for weeks, according to the studies by the \\nCalifornia Department of Health Services and the Johns Hopkins University \\nSchool of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. Combined, the researchers \\ntested the lungs of more than 100 California wildland firefighters before and \\nafter the 1988 and 1989 fire seasons. \\n\\nHealth experts also suspect that exposure to wildfire smoke may accelerate \\naging, prompt fatal heart attacks or cancer and trigger respiratory diseases \\nsuch as chronic bronchitis or asthma. \\n\\n\"After fires, they cough up black gunk. Then, after a week, they think they\\'re \\nback to normal. But our studies show their lungs aren\\'t back to normal,\" said \\nDr. Robert Harrison, the California health department\\'s chief of occupational \\nhealth surveillance and the physician in charge of one of the studies. \\n\\n\"For some of the firefighters, the drop in lung function was rather striking.\" \\n\\nThe worst doses of carbon monoxide and other hazardous chemicals, which can be \\nfatal, are given off when fires smolder, the stage in which firefighters spend \\nmost of their time, said Darold Ward, a U.S. Forest Service chemist. \\n\\nMark Linane, who heads a national firefighting crew known as the Hotshots, said \\nhe has seen wildland firefighters so poisoned by carbon monoxide that they \\ncan\\'t decide which shoe to tie. \\n\\nThe hazards are particularly acute in Southern California, which is prone to \\nmore large, smoky fires than anywhere else in the nation. Its four-year drought \\nhas turned grasslands tinder dry, and its stagnant weather conditions and \\ntopography can trap smoke for days. \\n\\nFurthermore, forestry officials predict that the region\\'s 1990 fire season will \\nbe devastating. \\n\\nThe Yosemite fires, which have scorched more than 15,000 acres and are still \\nout of control, and the recent Santa Barbara and Glendale fires, which \\ndestroyed nearly 500 homes, are only the largest of hundreds of blazes in the \\nstate. \\n\\n\"We\\'ve got lots of summer ahead of us and we\\'ve already burned 600 or 700 \\nstructures,\" said Deputy Chief Keith Metcalfe of the state\\'s southern regional \\nfirefighting crew in Riverside. \" . . . Because of the dryness, fires are \\nburning more rapidly and more intensely.\" \\n\\nFor nearly 10 years, urban firefighters have known that toxic smoke from \\nburning structures and cars greatly increases their chances of cancer and heart \\ndisease. The bandannas that once were their only protection were replaced by \\nair tanks and masks long ago. \\n\\nBut the U.S. Forest Service and state and county fire officials have been \\nunable to protect their wildfire crews because they know of no gear light \\nenough for firefighters to wear while hiking miles in burning terrain or \\neffective enough to filter out the wide variety of toxic materials in smoke. \\n\\nFurthermore, developing protection for the crews has gotten little attention \\nand virtually no state or federal funding. \\n\\nNational fire officials say they cannot get help from Congress unless they can \\nprove firefighters are dropping dead. But because no mortality studies have \\nbeen funded, all they have is the old joke heard around the fire camp: Just try \\nto find a wildland firefighter still breathing after 60. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a crime that we continue to let these guys function like this,\" said \\nJames Johnson, director of hazard control projects at Lawrence Livermore \\nNational Laboratory in Northern California, which is developing respiratory \\ngear for its firefighters. \"They\\'re a forgotten group, a hidden subset of \\npeople who have been ignored en masse. In all my 18 years of experience in \\nindustrial hygiene, I\\'ve never seen anything like it.\". \\n\\nIn the past, firefighters believed their coughing and congestion were fleeting \\nside effects. But the new health studies have documented physiological changes \\nin the lungs and airways that do not vanish with the smoke. \\n\\nThe Johns Hopkins tests, conducted on 52 Northern California wildland \\nfirefighters during the 1988 season, showed that their lung function -- or flow \\nof oxygen -- remained reduced by as much as 3% even eight weeks after exposure. \\nThe researchers said they have not determined if the lungs heal between seasons \\nor if the damage accumulates. \\n\\nThe California health department\\'s tests on 63 firefighters showed they lost as \\nmuch as 10% of their lung capacity during one six-month fire season, with an \\naverage loss of 4%. \\n\\nFor many firefighters, the lung congestion turns into bronchitis or walking \\npneumonia three times a year, said Linane, 46, who has fought wildfires for 28 \\nyears. \\n\\n\"You take antibiotics and it eventually goes away,\" Linane said. \"But then it \\ncomes back. And more often.\" \\n\\nDuring the four months of fires in 1988 at Yellowstone National Park, 12,000 \\nfirefighters sought medical aid for respiratory problems, and about 600 needed \\na doctor\\'s care after returning home, a U.S. Forest Service report says. \\n\\nStan Stewart, 37, said he knew when he joined the Forest Service at 17 that the \\njob was dangerous. But he didn\\'t know he would feel sicker and sicker every \\nyear. \\n\\n\"The doctor told me I look like I\\'ve smoked 10 packs of cigarettes a day all my \\nlife. But I\\'ve never smoked,\" said Stewart, foreman of the Hotshot crew in Los \\nPadres National Forest near Ojai. \"My lungs are probably shot. I\\'m a little \\nmore worried every year.\" \\n\\nHealth researchers, usually reluctant to interfere in policy decisions, said \\nthey feel strongly enough about the hazard that they are urging fire officials \\nto provide respiratory protection as soon as possible. \\n\\n\"We\\'re not surprised firefighters have decreased lung function. We just wanted \\nto document it so the firefighting agencies would take action,\" said Dr. John \\nBalmes, a pulmonary specialist and occupational health expert at UC San \\nFrancisco who helped with the state\\'s study. \\n\\nHarrison said the forestry agencies and fire departments should at least warn \\ntheir crews -- and potential recruits -- of the danger and consider rotating \\nshifts more often to reduce smoke exposure. \\n\\nAlthough the findings of the national studies have not yet been published, word \\nhas spread to top officials in the state Forestry Department, who say they are \\nnow starting to search for protection for the agency\\'s 3,500 full-time \\nfirefighters and about 2,000 seasonal ones. \\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to wait for firefighters to die,\" said Jack Wiest, the \\ndepartment\\'s chief of fire planning and research. \"We have to get on this right \\nnow.\" \\n\\nPart of the solution is to develop lightweight and long-lasting respirators. \\n\\nAir tanks and masks that are standard for fighting structural fires weigh 40 \\npounds and last only 15 to 30 minutes, so they are impractical for wildfire \\ncrews that hike miles carrying as much as 60 pounds of hoses and tools. \\n\\nDeveloping technology, however, takes money, and none has been allocated by \\nCalifornia forestry officials. \\n\\n\"Respiratory protection for wildland firefighters is non-existent. And we\\'re \\nlooking at a couple of years, at least, before something is developed,\" Wiest \\nsaid. \\n\\nLast year, researchers from the U.S. Forest Service and Johns Hopkins asked \\nCongress to fund a $13.4-million, four-year study to analyze the health threat \\nand develop respiratory protection. \\n\\nBut William Sommers, director of forest fire research for the National Wildfire \\nCoordinating Group, said national funds are scarce. His group, which includes \\nall federal and state agencies involved in wildland firefighting, now gets less \\nthan half the research money it received 15 to 20 years ago. \\n\\nThis year, about $10 million, less than 1% of the federal dollars spent on \\nfighting wildland fires, is set aside for research. Sommers said no other \\nfederal agency devotes that little, especially when jobs are life-threatening. \\n\\nOther hazard-prone occupational groups, such as chemical workers and \\nconstruction crews, are much better protected, he said. Most employers are \\nrequired by federal regulations to provide equipment that protects workers from \\ndangerous fumes or other threats. \\n\\nFirefighters themselves -- who traditionally have brandished the attitude that \\nif you can\\'t stand the heat, you get out of the fire -- are now demanding \\nprotection. \\n\\nTheir change in attitude came largely as a result of the unforgettable \\nCalifornia summer of 1987. \\n\\nIn what was called the \"Siege of \\'87,\" 1,500 fires attacked the Klamath \\nNational Forest near the California-Oregon border in one month. A strong \\ninversion layer settled into the valley, trapping the thick smoke for the \\nentire time. \\n\\nThe firefighters\\' union, concerned that crews were falling ill in record \\nnumbers, asked Johns Hopkins University to send a doctor. Dr. Patrick Ford, \\nthen a medical resident specializing in occupational health, looked at the \\nfirefighters\\' base camp, which was engulfed by a thick fog of black smoke. \\n\\n\"We were miserable within hours of arriving. Nose burning, throat burning, eyes \\nburning. And it didn\\'t go away,\" said Ford, now an occupational medicine \\nphysician for the Navy in Philadelphia. \\n\\nPolice officers at the camp, called in to direct traffic, were using \\nflashlights at noon because they couldn\\'t see 20 yards in front of them. Ford \\nrecalled that some of the officers wore gas masks, yet the firefighters wore \\nonly bandannas. The crews slept in makeshift tents -- cotton sheets strung over \\nclotheslines. Because the camp offered no respite from the smoke, the \\nfirefighters breathed it 24 hours a day for several weeks. \\n\\nFord questioned the firefighters about their health and was shocked by how many \\nhad alarming symptoms. He listened to their chests, and heard wheezing in \\nalmost every one. \\n\\nCandace Gregory, 33, the first woman battalion chief at the California \\nDepartment of Forestry, recalls that 11 members on her crew of 15 fell ill. \\n\\n\"You were literally living in the smoke. After a while, you were coughing all \\nthe time,\" she said. \\n\\nImmediately after the 1987 fires, Ford and other researchers from Johns Hopkins \\nand the California health department mounted studies. \\n\\n\"It\\'s the old cliche of how you don\\'t put up that traffic signal at a dangerous \\nintersection until there\\'s a lot of people killed,\" Wiest said. \\n\\nNow 46 and working his 28th fire season, Linane will retire in a few years. \\nLooking back, he says, \"When the adrenaline\\'s pumping and you\\'re saving \\nproperty and lives and important natural resources, it seems worth it. But when \\nI retire and I\\'m coughing and gagging, it may be another story. \\n\\n\"The doctor here recommended that I take full pulmonary tests. I said, \\'Yeah, \\nyeah, sure.\\' But I never did it. I\\'m afraid he\\'ll tell me there\\'s really \\nsomething wrong. We\\'re all afraid to do it. None of us wants to know how much \\nlung function we\\'ve really lost.\" \\n\\nYOSEMITE FIRES: While the flames slowed, concern remained high over possible \\nnew lightning storms. A3 \\n\\n\\nHOW POISONS IN SMOKE AFFECT FIREFIGHTERS \\n\\nWild-land firefighters are exposed to a variety of poisonous substances in the \\nsmoke they breathe. When forest material or brush catches fire, the incomplete \\ncombustion turns the harmless vegetation into a barrage of dangerous chemicals. \\n\\nThe Poisons: \\n\\n1. Carbon Monoxide -- This invisible odorless gas attacks the brain and nervous \\nsystem of a firefighter, causing temporary disorientation, impaired judgment \\nand slower reaction times. It also puts extreme stress on the heart. \\n\\n2. Inorganic Compounds -- Including lead and sulphur, these materials vary \\nwidely in smoke, depending on the content of the soil. Lead, found in high \\nconcentrations in smoke from Southern California wildland fires, can cause \\nneurological damage. \\n\\n3. Aldehydes -- These strong irritants, especially acrolein and formaldehyde, \\nare found in high concentrations in smoke. They are believed to cause much of \\nthe wheezing, coughing and eye irritation suffered by wild-land firefighters. \\nMany of them are also carcinogens. \\n\\n4. Particulates -- These small pieces of black carbon lodge deep in the lungs, \\npossibly causing asthma, chronic bronchitis and cancer. The smallest particles, \\nwhich are the most dangerous to lungs, are found in smoldering fires, where \\nfirefighters spend most of their time. \\n\\n5. Ozone -- This potent chemical is formed during fires when there is strong \\nsunlight and smoke is trapped by stagnant weather patterns. Human tests show \\nozone, which is also the main ingredient of smog, hampers lung function, while \\nanimal tests indicate it can cause chronic respiratory disease. \\n\\n6. Organic Acids -- Including formic acid and acetic acid, these chemicals are \\npowerful irritants to the lungs, eyes and throat. \\n\\n\\nThe Protection: \\n\\nBandanna: Wild-land firefighters wear nothing but a thin cloth on their face to \\nprotect their lungs from smoke. Fire officials say they haven\\'t found \\nlightweight respiratory equipment that is effective and safe for the crews, who \\nhave to trek uphill wearing 60 pounds of equipment. \\n\\nEquipment: Standard gear usually includes a hosepack, helmet, goggles, boots \\nand a fire-retardant jumpsuit. \\n\\nAir Purifier: Fire crews at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory wear 1-pound \\nair purifiers. The smoky air passes through filters that eliminate tiny soot \\nparticles that can lodge in lungs. Gases such as carbon monoxide, however, are \\nnot filtered out. National and state fire officials remain wary of the \\npurifiers because they don\\'t provide full protection from smoke. \\n\\n\\nPolynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons: These Compounds, believed to be \\ncancer-causing agents, attach to particles of soot in wild-land fires. Experts \\nare uncertain whether the compounds cause genetic damage in blood cells. \\n\\nSources: USDA Forest Service Intermountain Research Station, California \\nDepartment of Health Services and Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene \\nand Public Health, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nPopulation experts say that little would change in allocating seats in Congress if two sides get their way in trying to force changes in the 1990 census.

He believe the recurring temptation to legislate vengeance on adversaries will backfire. Oklahoma has limited state lawmakers to 12 years\\' service. This will create more amateurs who will be controlled by governors and bureaucrats and more vulnerable to corruption. Additionally, office holders will not have a stake in their job and will be more concerned with their next job. Lobbyists and legislative staffs will be celebrating the guaranteed influx of inexperienced office holders. Baker considers term limits illogical and wrong, and an insult to the voters.\\nIntroduction:\\nThere is a recurring temptation in American politics to wreak vengeance on \\none\\'s adversaries by overhauling the political institutions that they dominate. \\nWhat usually results from this ill-considered radical surgery is that the very \\npeople who scheduled the operations end up in the recovery room. \\n\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\'s plan to expand the Supreme Court in 1937 to dilute the \\nvotes of conservatives resulted in the creation of an opposing political \\ncoalition that lived on after the controversy to plague every subsequent \\nDemocratic President. The Republicans in 1951 wanted to ensure that there would \\nnever be another F.D.R., so they pushed through the 22nd Amendment limiting \\npresidents to two terms. The first President to come under the restriction was \\nDwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican who might very well have won a third term. \\n\\nThe latest institutional patients to be wheeled into the shock-trauma unit are \\nthe state legislatures. The quack therapy being performed on them is the \\nimposition of limits on the number of terms that state lawmakers can serve. The \\nfirst cut took place on Sept. 18, when Oklahoma voters endorsed overwhelmingly \\na ballot initiative limiting state lawmakers to 12 years\\' service. \\n\\nBy itself, the term limitation in Oklahoma might be written off as a cranky act \\nof vengeance in a state not renowned as a political trend-setter, but similar \\nmeasures will be voted on in November in California and Colorado. \\n\\nEager for straws in the wind in an otherwise trendless political year, some \\njournalists have seen in the Oklahoma vote a backlash against incumbents, a \\nmanifestation of public alienation and an ominous sign to the Democrats, the \\nparty that holds the largest number of legislative seats. \\n\\nThe Oklahoma referendum is none of these. It is, rather, the kind of minor \\npolitical tempest that gets highlighted briefly by the media, is copied in a \\nfew places and then disappears. It is Republicans, naturally enough, who seem \\nto be the most enthusiastic puffers of term limitation, since they have the \\nmost to gain, at least in the short term, from an indiscriminate clean-out of \\nthe nation\\'s deliberative bodies. \\n\\nWhat makes term limitation such a singularly inappropriate tool is the almost \\ntotal lack of connection between the fancied sins of the lawmakers and the \\ndiscipline proposed. The very weakness and vulnerability to corruption that \\nhave often plagued state legislatures usually result from the amateurism of \\nlawmakers -- the quality that term-limitation backers now assert as a virtue. \\n\\nWhere state legislators are underpaid, have no professional staffs and meet \\nrarely, they usually come under the sway of full-time governors, \\nexecutive-branch bureaucrats and highly paid lobbyists. Indeed, the goal of \\nlegislative reformers for the past 50 years has been more professionalism in \\nthe state assemblies, not less. \\n\\nBy turning out the legislators every 12 years -- or even worse, every six years \\n-- you pretty much guarantee that those who are elected won\\'t have much of a \\nstake in their jobs. They will use them as temporary hitching posts on their \\nway to other offices without term limitations. Not every state lawmaker has his \\neye on a seat in the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives. But it\\'s a safe \\nbet that more people will be using state seats to groom for higher office if \\nthey know that the law will force them out soon. \\n\\nLobbyists, of course, will rejoice. Their influence over these legislative \\nbirds of passage will grow because they will be guaranteed a perennial crop of \\ncallow and ignorant lawmakers. One thing that legislators now have going for \\nthem is that they can become conversant with public issues and so challenge, if \\nthey care to, the self-serving propaganda of the special interests. \\n\\nCelebrating, along with the lobbyists, will be the legislative staffs whose \\ntenure would be unaffected. These unelected officials are permanent and beyond \\nthe reach of voters, while the very people who are in some measure accountable \\nwill be hustled out of office. \\n\\nUltimately, what the term limit amounts to is an indictment of citizenship. It \\nis an admission that the voters are civic imbeciles who cannot discriminate \\nbetween bad lawmakers and good ones. Where surgical strikes are needed to \\neliminate the incompetent or corrupt, the term limitation uses carpet bombing \\nin the hope that in the resulting carnage, some of the guilty will suffer along \\nwith the innocent. \\n\\nAt the most basic level, term limitation is just flat-out wrongheaded and \\nillogical: To throw everybody out when all you want to do is throw out the \\nrascals is like burning down your house in order to get rid of the rats. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThousands are preparing to witness the July 11 total eclipse of the sun. Talismans of all sorts, protective viewing lenses and \"power vortex\" energy gathering crystals are being sold at locations along the eclipse\\'s path. Meanwhile, authorities in the primary viewing areas, Mexico\\'s Baja California Sur and the big island of Hawaii are concerned that the infrastructure may not be adequate to accommodate the expected crowds. Hawaii is expecting 30,000 more tourists than the normal 18,000 for this time of year. Transportation systems will be strained. Further, everyone is being warned extensively about serious eye damage caused by improper viewing.\\nIntroduction:\\nOf all the extravagant plans inspired by this week\\'s solar eclipse, none beats\\nthe Earth Evacuation Project.\\nParticipants in Mexico believe the total\\neclipse, which will send a shadow racing from Hawaii to Brazil as the moon\\ncrosses directly in front of the sun, will cause volcanic eruptions, signaling\\nEarthlings to start bailing out on spaceships to the fourth dimension,\\naccording to Intergalactic Guardian command leader \"Angel,\" who declined to\\ngive a last name.  \\n\\nWhile Angel and his followers meditate to prepare for their journey, French\\nNew Age musician Jean-Michel Jarre is coordinating an elaborate\\nsound-and-light show to play at the foot of the pyramids in Teotihuacan, north\\nof the capital.\\nAlso on E-day, July 11, crowded cruise ships will linger\\noff Mexico\\'s Pacific Coast, and thousands of U.S. tourists will drive south\\ninto Baja California, which, usually boasting clear skies, is being billed as\\nthe world\\'s most promising site from which to view nature\\'s own light show.\\n Eclipse fans from Japan to New York to the Netherlands are expected in\\ndroves, but Californians -- because of their proximity to Baja and propensity\\nfor mystical phenomena -- should be conspicuous.\\nHowever, the chic hot\\nspot for eclipse watchers won\\'t be Mexico, but the big island of Hawaii, where\\nthe 18,000 tourists who would be there anyway to enjoy the sunshine will be\\njoined by an additional 30,000 or more coming to watch the sun go out for four\\nminutes.\\nEven more people might be there for the show, but for the lack of\\nseats on flights to the island. Most visitors will be funneled in through the\\nrelatively small airport at Kailua.\\nAirlines are adding scores of flights\\nto ferry thousands of people from neighboring islands in the hours just before\\nthe eclipse.\\nCar rental companies have shipped in 3,000 or so extra cars.\\n   More than one caller from the mainland has asked the visitors\\' bureau\\nwhether the island is in danger of tipping over under the tourists\\' weight.\\n But Mexico will host the biggest share of travelers, partly because of its\\neasy access from the United States and partly since the eclipse will last\\nlongest here: up to seven minutes, which is three more minutes than the\\nmaximum length in Hawaii. This will also be the longest-lasting total eclipse\\nuntil 2132, according to Alan Dyer, an associate editor at Astronomy\\nmagazine.\\nThe midday eclipse will consist of a 160-mile wide lunar shadow\\nspeeding at up to 5,000 miles per hour along the Earth\\'s surface.\\nWhile\\nmany Mexicans are looking forward to the event, some are quietly taking\\nprecautions. In pre-Colombian times, eclipses were viewed as bad omens by the\\nsun-worshiping Aztecs.\\nIn the capital\\'s Sonora market, specializing in\\nmagic, vendors have stocked up on garlic bulbs tied with red ribbon, which\\nthey hawk as protection from \"the bad vibrations of the eclipse.\" A thriving\\ntrade is also taking place in magnets, for those with low blood pressure to\\ncarry in their pockets on July 11, and old copper coins for pregnant women to\\nplace as charms in their belly buttons.\\nAs in Hawaii, Mexico could\\nprobably use some otherworldly intervention to cope with the scores of\\nthousands of tourists who have already started arriving.\\nIn the southern\\nhalf of the Baja Peninsula, some hotels have had rooms reserved for more than\\na year.

The plane evidently exploded in the air. The flight was out of Heathrow in London and at a normal cruising altitude of 31,000 feet. Authorities believe the cause is sabotage. A bomb threat had been made against Pan Am jetliners, and the State Department had passed the information along to Pan Am. A radical Palestinian group is believed responsible.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Here, at a glance, are developments today involving the crash of\\nPan American World Airways Flight 103 Wednesday night in Lockerbie,\\nScotland, that killed all 259 people aboard and more than 20 people\\non the ground:\\n   The jumbo jet, a Boeing 747, apparently exploded in the air\\nbefore crashing and investigators focused on terrorist threats to\\nplace a bomb on a Pan Am airliner.\\n   The crash occurred 54 minutes after takeoff from London\\'s\\nHeathrow Airport following a routine climb to a cruising altitude of\\n31,000 feet.

One writer comments that 99.6 percent of handguns are not involved in crimes. Clearly, says the writer, it is not gun control but crime control and further, that criminals ignore gun control laws. Another writer believes that Gartner is intent on removing handguns from society. A third writer suggests that Gartner distorts the Second Amendment when he claims that it refers to the arming of a militia.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nIn his \"Gun Control Is Constitutional\" (Counterpoint,\\nop-ed page, Dec. 12), the American Enterprise Institute\\'s\\nRobert A. Goldwin\\'s principal concern, it seems, is to deny\\nthat the right to keep and bear arms precludes the power to\\nregulate gun ownership and use. Few would disagree. Even\\nactivities protected by the First Amendment may be regulated\\nwhen they threaten the rights of others.\\n\\nBut Mr. Goldwin also writes that \"The right to bear arms\\nprotected in the Second Amendment has to do directly with `a\\nwell-regulated militia\\'\"; thus, arguably, he continues, \"if\\nyou want to own a gun, sign up with the National Guard.\"\\nClearly, this goes well beyond regulating to protect the\\nrights of others. This would condition the \"right\" to keep\\nand bear arms on joining the National Guard.\\n\\nMr. Goldwin\\'s mistake stems from his having confused a\\nnecessary with a sufficient condition. The Second Amendment,\\nin its language and its history, makes plain that the need\\nfor a well-regulated militia is a sufficient condition for\\nthe right to keep and bear arms. Yet Mr. Goldwin treats it as\\na necessary condition, which enables him to conclude that\\nCongress could deny an individual the right to own a gun if\\nhe did not join the National Guard.\\n\\nMr. Goldwin makes this mistake, in turn, because he has\\nmisread Madison\\'s original version of the Second Amendment,\\nwhich exempted conscientious objectors from military service.\\nThus he says that \"In this version, `bearing arms\\' must mean\\n`to render military service,\\' or why else would there have to\\nbe an exemption for religious reasons? What right must not be\\ninfringed? The right of the people to serve in the militia.\"\\n\\nPlainly, any conscientious-objector provision would arise\\nnot from a right but from a duty to serve in the militia. Yet\\nMr. Goldwin believes the amendment means, as he later says,\\n\"that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the\\nmilitia.\" Thus does he reduce the first of these rights to\\nthe second, when clearly it is much broader.\\n\\nRoger Pilon\\n\\nSenior Fellow and Director\\n\\nCenter for Constitutional Studies\\n\\nCATO Institute\\n\\nWashington\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nIn response to a \"free market\" stand against government imposition of term limits, this author (Edward Crane) claims two reasons for term limits that economists should appreciate. One, the less time a politician is in Washington the less his common sense will be corrupted by the \"cult to ruling\". Two, few individuals who want to spend the rest of their life in Washington will be elected. Crane feels Congress needs experience in living in the \"real world,\" but productive citizens do not want to commit 10 to 15 years to politics. Six-year limits on House service could be viewed as only a leave of absence from real careers.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nAs an economist, Robert Barro (\"A Free Marketeer\\'s Case\\nAgainst Term Limits\" editorial page, Dec. 24) sees no\\ndifference between minimum-wage legislation, rent control and\\nother government interventions in the free market, and the\\nintervention of congressional term limitation. Mr. Barro\\nargues that as one should have confidence in the wisdom of\\nconsumers, so one should, when dealing with the electoral\\nprocess, \"have similar confidence in the public.\" But his\\ndewy-eyed, high-school-civics-text vision of the American\\nelectoral process is naive at best. Incumbent legislators\\nhave carefully crafted a web of perks and privileges that\\nmake challenging them a futile crusade, unless they happen to\\nbe convicted of child molestation, in which case the race may\\nbe closer.\\n\\nHad the Framers envisioned the kind of Imperial Congress\\nwe have today, they without question would have included term\\nlimits in the Constitution. As it was, tradition dictated\\n\"rotation in office,\" and the need to spell out such a\\nrestriction was deemed unnecessary. With 95% re-election\\nrates, times have changed.\\n\\nThere are two solid reasons for congressional term\\nlimitation that economists, at least those of the\\npublic-choice persuasion, should fully appreciate. First, the\\nless time that a politician spends inside the Beltway the\\nless his or her common sense will be corrupted by the\\n\"culture of ruling\" that exists there. To have microphones\\npushed in your face every day and to be asked your opinion on\\neverything under the sun is a corrupting influence. Soon you\\nstart thinking your opinion is more important than it really\\nis and, worse, that perhaps you should codify your opinion on\\neverything under the sun. Other than this corruption of\\ncommon sense, for instance, what could explain Congress\\'s\\nattempt to repeal the laws of economics through federal\\ndeposit insurance?\\n\\nSecond, term limits end the adverse pre-selection process\\nthat exists whereby most individuals seeking office today\\nactually find the prospect of spending the rest of their\\nlives in Washington, D.C., attractive. Such individuals are\\nthe last ones we should want passing laws governing the rest\\nof us. What Congress needs is experience in living in the\\nreal world, not in passing legislation. Today, business\\npeople, teachers, computer programmers and other productive\\ncitizens look at the prospect of running for Congress and\\nrecognize that they must be willing to commit 10 or 15 years\\nof their lives to being politicians if they expect to have\\nany legislative influence. They opt not to run.\\n\\nWith six-year limits in the House (which most term-limit\\ninitiatives are now proposing for state congressional\\ndelegations), such individuals would recognize that they\\nwould immediately be on a par with their colleagues in\\nCongress and that they would not have to give up their\\nproductive careers in the private sector in order to serve.\\nIndeed, a true citizen Congress would consist of legislators\\nwho view their time there as essentially a leave of absence\\nfrom their real jobs. Certainly the composition of Congress\\nunder term limitation would reflect something other than 95%\\nmen and 46% lawyers, as it does now.\\n\\nSeventy-five percent of Americans support term limitation\\n-- everyone from Ralph Nader to Milton Friedman -- because\\nthey recognize it as an opportunity for citizens to wrest\\ncontrol of government from an impervious Congress full of\\ncheck-bouncing, power-lusting professional politicians.\\n\\nEdward H.

Exxon notes that the spill did not wipe out any species and that surviving animals can rebuild populations. But the US Fish and Wildlife Service says that could take 70 years. Joseph Hazelwood is on trial for drunken driving of the vessel as captain. Criminal indictments have been issued against Exxon and they also face more than 150 civil lawsuits.\\nIntroduction:\\n   From a helicopter, the wave-washed\\nbeach looks as if the worst oil spill in U.S. history had never\\ntouched it.\\n   Silvery sticks of driftwood poke through a deep blanket of snow,\\nand smooth gray pebbles roll in the surf under the gaze of a bald\\neagle perched in a shoreside spruce.\\n   But the view doesn\\'t impress Joe Bridgman of the Alaska\\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation. Dashing out as the\\nchopper lands, he digs into the cobble beach and quickly finds what\\nhe knew he would.\\n   ``Oil,\\'\\' he says. ``Smell it?\\'\\'\\n   The pungent odor of petroleum wafts through the air as the hole\\nturns black with crude oil, an oozing remnant of the 10.8 million\\ngallons spilled into Prince William Sound last March 24 by the\\ntanker Exxon Valdez.\\n   Bridgman scoops up a shovelful of gravel, lugs it to the water\\'s\\nedge and dumps it in. A rainbow sheen of oil spreads across the\\nwater.\\n   ``Hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under this beach,\\'\\'\\nhe says. ``And this isn\\'t isolated. There are hundreds of beaches\\nall over the sound that are still oiled, and the oil is slowly\\nbleeding out.\\n   ``The beaches can look beautiful at the surface, but you can dig\\ndown, in this case just a few inches below the surface, and find\\nlots of oil. Now, is that a threat or isn\\'t it?\\'\\'\\n   A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, the question clings\\nlike the oil under this Perry Island beach. Certainly, the worst is\\nover; thousands of dead birds no longer wash up on shorelines as\\nthey did last summer.\\n   But assessing the continuing damage wrought by the nation\\'s most\\nextensive _ and expensive _ oil spill has just begun. As a growing\\nslick of lawyers haggles over who is to blame, Exxon Corp. and\\ngovernment agencies debate how to clean up what\\'s left and\\nscientists track wildlife populations\\' first steps on the long road\\nto recovery.\\n   Any hope of a quick solution faded last summer as oil from the\\nExxon Valdez spread across 1,100 miles of Alaska\\'s wild southern\\ncoast.\\n   A cleanup army of 12,000 workers polished rocks by hand, blasted\\nbeaches with hot water and sprayed fertilizer to promote the growth\\nof oil-eating microbes.\\n   But when Exxon suspended its $2 billion cleanup in\\nmid-September, it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the\\noil spilled, state officials estimate. About 20 percent to 40\\npercent is believed to have evaporated. That leaves 50 percent to\\n75 percent of the oil in the water, on the ocean bottom or on\\nbeaches.\\n   Some was soaked up by unwilling sponges: the seabirds, eagles\\nand sea otters whose carcasses now lie frozen in five vans in an\\nAnchorage storage yard, awaiting their day as physical evidence in\\ncourt.\\n   Workers found more than 1,000 dead otters, a sizable chunk of\\nthe spill area\\'s total population of 15,000 to 22,000.\\n   Many of Prince William Sound\\'s 3,000 bald eagles also suffered;\\nat least 151 died, most poisoned by scavenging the oily remains of\\nsome of the 34,400 dead seabirds recovered.\\n   Those numbers alone make the Valdez spill the most lethal ever,\\nbut scientists say the actual death count is much higher,\\nestimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank\\nfrom sight or drifted out to sea.\\n   Exxon notes the spill did not wipe out any species and says\\nsurviving animals and birds will rebuild populations. But that may\\ntake up to 70 years for some hard-hit seabird colonies, U.S. Fish\\nand Wildlife Service researchers say.\\n   ``We never claimed that the spill put any animal on the\\nendangered species list, but that\\'s missing the point,\\'\\' said Fish\\nand Wildlife spokesman Bruce Batten. ``It\\'s still the greatest\\nhuman-caused wildlife disaster that this agency knows about.\\'\\'\\n   Oily carcasses were an obvious measure of the spill\\'s impact,\\nbut victims also included less visible members of the ecosystem,\\nsuch as young salmon and tiny intertidal creatures.\\n   Assessment studies for these populations are not finished, and\\neven preliminary findings are hard to come by _ researchers have\\nbeen told by lawyers to save their findings for court, where it\\nseems nearly everyone involved in the spill is headed.\\n   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, skipper of the Exxon Valdez, is on trial\\nthis month in Anchorage on charges including criminal mischief and\\ndrunken driving of his vessel, and a federal grand jury recently\\nissued criminal indictments against Exxon, starting a case that\\ncould take years to finish.\\n   Exxon already faces more than 150 civil lawsuits.\\n   Fishermen sued because of lost seasons.

His Domestic Policy Council drafted a blueprint giving states wider latitude to experiment with reform. Many governors have unveiled plans of their own. A welfare lobbying coalition of 80 organizations has issued a statement calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs. They insist that the federal government has \"primary responsibility\" for welfare. Congressional Democrats seem to agree with them. Americans are already spending more than $100 billion a year on welfare. It may be necessary for Reagan to form an alliance of reform-minded governors and the public to change the status quo.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nIn his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years. \\nHe instructed his charges to draw up plans for \"immediate action\" that would enable poor families to achieve \"real and lasting emancipation\" from welfare dependency. \\n\"The success of welfare,\" he said, \"should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of welfare.\" \\n\\n\\nThe president\\'s convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families. \\nAmericans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty. \\nThe president correctly sensed that the public wants reform. \\n\\n\\nIf the president lets up on welfare reform, he will disappoint those whose hopes he raised last January, a group that surely includes many of the poor who understand better than any politician how deficient the current system is. \\nTo build on the momentum he created a year ago, the president must make plain his commitment in the State of the Union message next Tuesday. \\nTo pull away now would be to undercut the welfare-reform movement just as it has hit its stride. \\n\\n\\nThe president ought to challenge Congress to respond to his initiatives. \\nHis Domestic Policy Council has drafted a blueprint. \\nIt would give the states wider latitude to experiment with welfare programs. \\nMany of the governors seem to like the plan, as they have already unveiled their own proposals for welfare reform. \\nThe president and the governors should be natural allies on this issue, and the chances of success would be enhanced if they could jointly commit themselves to a plan of action. \\n\\n\\nThe president will need all the help he can get if he is to convince Democrats in Congress to go along. \\nMost have paid lip service to the idea of welfare reform but nary a bill has been put on the docket. \\nThis suggests that the Democrats aren\\'t as serious about welfare reform as the governors and the American public are. \\n\\n\\nThere is a reason for this. \\nThe Democrats have long been beholden to the welfare lobby, whose interests now have less to do with alleviating poverty than with enlarging the welfare bureaucracy. \\nThis past December, a coalition of some 80 organizations, most with headquarters in Washington, issued a \"statement of principles\" calling for increased spending for poverty and jobs programs. \\nIt also insisted that the federal government has \"primary responsibility\" for operating welfare. \\n\\n\\nCongressional Democrats seem to be in agreement with the welfare lobby. \\nHowever, the public wants the system changed. \\nIt will be difficult for Congress to sell restored or additional spending on current poverty programs when the American people are already spending more than $100 billion a year on these programs. \\n\\n\\nThe president should take up his case for reform directly with the American people. \\nWith the alliance of reform-minded governors and the support of the public, the president can press Congress to move off the deadening status quo. \\nWith the ball in its court, Congress can decide either to work with the president and the governors, or it can continue to place the interests of the welfare lobby ahead of the interests of the poor. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nCoast Guard Commandant Yost attacked Exxon\\'s plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill. Also, consumer activist Ralph Nader, other environmentalists, and politicians expressed anger in a one day \"Boycott Exxon\" campaign. The cleanup is to be paid for by the oil industry and could add $100-500M to Alaska\\'s economy, more than offsetting the loss to the fishing industry. Thousands of dead birds were spotted 300 miles from the spill site. Since the Exxon Valdez spill, gas prices have increased 10% nationally and as much as 25% in the Northwest. Nebraska\\'s two senators have asked the US Attorney General to investigate possible price gouging by the oil industry.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost on\\nTuesday attacked Exxon\\'s plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill.\\nConsumers, politicians and environmentalists expressed their anger\\nin a one-day ``Boycott Exxon\\'\\' campaign.\\n   Yost, the top federal official tracking the environmental\\ndisaster, said Exxon\\'s plan was poorly drafted and lacking in\\nspecifics. But he stopped short of rejecting it, saying he wanted\\nto meet with Exxon and state officials.\\n   In Washington, consumer activist Ralph Nader said Exxon ``should\\nnot be allowed to forget\\'\\' the spill and that a boycott would send\\nthe oil giant a message.\\n   He and others blasted Exxon for failing to be prepared for the\\nspill and not rapidly responding to the accident that fouled\\nhundreds of miles of Alaska\\'s coast. They also questioned\\nsubsequent increases in gas prices.\\n   ``We are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil\\ncompany that doesn\\'t understand its responsibility to protect the\\nenvironment,\\'\\' Massachusetts state Sen. Carol Amick told a boycott\\nrally in Boston.\\n   In Anchorage, about 400 chanting and sign-waving protesters\\nrallied in front of Exxon\\'s Alaskan headquarters to urge a consumer\\nboycott.\\n   J. Edward Surette Jr., executive director of the Bay State\\nGasoline Retailers Association in Billerica, Mass., said it was too\\nearly to assess the boycott\\'s impact.\\n   Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Johnson said 10,000 credit cards out of\\n7 million have been cut up and returned to the company since the\\nspill.\\n   The oil company\\'s cleanup strategy must gain Yost\\'s approval\\nbefore being put into effect. Yost said he would make a decision on\\nthe proposal within a week.\\n   ``The plan is very thin,\\'\\' he told a news briefing. ``There\\'s\\nnot a lot of backup or substantiation. It was quite light, very\\nthin. There must have been a lot of figures there that I haven\\'t\\nseen.\\n   ``We are going to be done this summer,\\'\\' Yost said. ``Some\\nbeaches are going to be sparkling, some beaches are going to be far\\nfrom sparkling.\\'\\'\\n   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who is to make his\\nsecond trip to Alaska on Wednesday as overall coordinator for the\\ncleanup, said he expected the size of the operation to double or\\ntriple by the end of the month.\\n   In a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, Skinner\\ncalled the spill ``the most significant environmental disaster this\\nnation has ever faced.\\'\\'\\n   However, he said the cleanup, to be paid for by the oil\\nindustry, could add $100 million to $500 million to Alaska\\'s\\neconomy, which he said is more than the effect of the fishing\\nindustry.\\n   Exxon released a statement that called the boycott unjust. Exxon\\nPresident William D. Stevens said the company was ``turning heaven\\nand Earth to set things right.\\'\\'\\n   Exxon\\'s 60-page, two-part revised strategy to cleanse some 364\\nmiles of Alaska\\'s coastline of the oil spilled March 24 by the\\ntanker Exxon Valdez was released Monday. The tanker struck a reef\\n25 miles from Valdez, spilling more than 10 million gallons of\\ncrude oil into Prince William Sound.\\n   About 300 miles from the spill site, an observer saw thousands\\nof dead birds in a wide tidal basin in the Hallo Bay area.\\n   ``We saw 2,000 to 3,000 dead birds. ... You can\\'t really tell\\nwhat they are. They\\'re one big blob of oil,\\'\\' said Ray Bane,\\nsuperintendent of Katmai National Park, about 275 miles southwest\\nof Valdez.\\n   ``We found large oil debris washing and slopping up on our\\nshores. ... It was very bad,\\'\\' Bane said. ``We saw eagles carrying\\noil-covered birds. We saw one eagle so coated in oil that it\\ncouldn\\'t fly.\\'\\'\\n   State and federal officials said the focus of the cleanup is\\nmoving southwest, following the drifting oil along the Alaska\\nPeninsula through the Shelikof Strait east of Kodiak Island. Oil\\nhas tainted the coast at least as far as Chignik, 525 miles\\nsouthwest of Valdez.\\n   The tanker is undergoing preliminary repairs in the sound, and\\nis to be moved next month to Portland, Ore., home of the only\\ndrydock on the West Coast capable of handling the 987-foot ship.\\n   In its proposal, Exxon said it wants to burn or bury the sludge\\nrecovered in the cleanup, which may require exemptions from Alaska\\nenvironmental law.\\n   But Bill Lamoreaux, the ranking state environmental officer at\\nthe spill, said the laws would not be relaxed. ``The general\\nfeeling is that we would expect that they would comply with the\\nenvironmental laws,\\'\\' Lamoreaux said.\\n   Exxon\\'s plan also notes that 191 miles of coastline it describes\\nas ``lightly oiled\\'\\' may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally\\nby wind and water.\\n   Lamoreaux said, ``When we talk about `light oiling,\\' it doesn\\'t\\nmean it won\\'t have a devastating effect on wildlife.\\'\\'\\n   U.S. Sens. James Exon and Bob Kerrey, both Nebraska Democrats,\\ncalled on U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to investigate\\npotential price gouging by the oil industry. They noted that gas\\nprices in Nebraska rose 20 percent from the first of March until\\nmid-April.\\n   State attorneys general in Washington, Oregon and Idaho echoed\\nthe call.\\n   Since the Exxon Valdez accident, gas prices have increased an\\naverage 10 percent nationally, while the Northwest saw surges as\\nhigh as 25 percent in less than a month, said Marla Rae, executive\\nassistant to Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer.\\n   At a news conference in Houston, Exxon President Stevens said it\\nshowed ``shocking naivete\\'\\' to blame the price hikes on his company.\\n   ``As you know,\\'\\' he told reporters, ``the market for petroleum\\nproducts is set by thousands of markets, thousands of independent\\ndealers across the nation.\\'\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nHere are some tornado facts.

The independent television station Yutel quoted a federal official\\nas saying the government did not approve of the military statement.\\nEarlier Saturday evening, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic forced yet\\nanother delay in the election of Stipe Mesic, a Croat, as president of\\nYugoslavia.\\nMesic election was key\\nMesic\\'s election was the political\\nkeystone in the peace plan, which also called for the federal troops in\\nSlovenia to return to the barracks and for a three-month delay by the\\nbreakaway republics of Slovenia and Croatia in carrying out their independence\\ndeclarations.\\nSlovenia refused Saturday night to send a representative to\\nBelgrade for a meeting of the eight-member Yugoslav presidency.

In New York City tuberculosis declined from 1960 to 1977, but by 1990, it has increased to the 1960 level. Many of the new cases occurred when individuals who had AIDS and lost the ability to suppress the latent tuberculosis that they might have carried for years. The rise in the tuberculosis actually began in the late 1970s, probably because of the large increase in the number of homeless, a group at great risk.\\nIntroduction:\\n   Drugs are now available that can put AIDS\\npatients into remission, and recent advances have made clear that a\\nvaccine to protect against AIDS infection is possible, a panel of\\nAIDS experts said Saturday.\\n   At the same time, however, the AIDS epidemic is being followed\\nby a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis, the scientists\\nsaid.\\n   ``We have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing\\nremission,\\'\\' said William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer\\nInstitute in Boston.\\n   ``I think there is evidence that a substantial number of people\\nwho would have died are now alive,\\'\\' Haseltine said at the annual\\nmeeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\\n   He cautioned against a premature conclusion that the AIDS\\nepidemic may be coming to an end.

Nearly one- quarter of 650 officers responding to a commission survey agreed that \"racial bias on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and community\". One of the commission members commented \"As troubling as some of our findings are...they are not unique to Los Angeles\".\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nLOS ANGELES -- A much-awaited report that paints a\\ndistressing picture of brutality and racism in the Los\\nAngeles Police Department, and that calls for the resignation\\nof its chief, could prompt changes in law enforcement\\nnationwide.\\n\\nThe report was issued yesterday by a commission appointed\\nby Mayor Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl Gates in the wake\\nof the videotaped beating March 3 of a black motorist, Rodney\\nKing, by Los Angeles police. The commission, headed by former\\nDeputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, found that a\\nsignificant number of officers use excessive force against\\nLos Angeles residents, a problem exacerbated by racism and\\nbias in the department.\\n\\nWhile the commission stopped short of blaming Chief Gates\\nfor these problems, it said that no chief should serve more\\nthan two consecutive five-year terms, and that Mr. Gates,\\nhaving served 13 years, should therefore turn in his badge\\nfollowing a transition period.\\n\\nBut the chief, who has remained steadfast through repeated\\ncalls from community leaders for his ouster, said later: \"I\\ndon\\'t expect to just run away\" from the job.\\n\\nNearly one-quarter of 650 officers responding to a\\ncommission survey agreed that \"racial bias on the part of\\nofficers toward minority citizens currently exists and\\ncontributes to a negative interaction between police and\\ncommunity,\" and in some cases \"may lead to the use of\\nexcessive force,\" the report said. A scant eight hours is\\ndevoted to cultural awareness training at the Los Angeles\\nPolice Academy, and many officers who train new recruits in\\nthe field openly perpetuate the \"siege mentality that\\nalienates patrol officers from the community,\" the commission\\nconcluded.\\n\\nOfficers commonly typed racial epithets to one another on\\ntheir patrol car computer systems, such as: \"Sounds like\\nmonkey slapping time\" and \"I almost got me a Mexican last\\nnight.\" Yet supervisors made no effort to monitor or control\\nthese messages, evidence of a \"significant breakdown in the\\ndepartment\\'s management responsibility,\" the report found.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has long been emulated\\nby others around the country because of its reputation for\\nbeing efficient and corruption-free. But the commission\\ncalled for a shift away from the force\\'s paramilitaristic,\\nus-against-them style, and said the department must embrace\\nthe \"community-based\" policing style that encourages officers\\nto spend less time in their cars and more time interacting\\nwith citizens in the communities they serve.\\n\\n\"This report will be a must-read for police chiefs around\\nthe country,\" said Hubert Williams, executive director of the\\nPolice Foundation, a Washington, D.C., law enforcement\\nresearch group. \"The word is clear: the public expects high\\nquality law enforcement within the parameters of the law.\"\\nMr. Williams likened the report to the Knapp Commission, a\\n1970s blue-ribbon study that exposed widespread corruption in\\nthe New York Police Department and led to significant\\nimprovements there.\\n\\n\"As troubling as some of our findings are . . . they are\\nnot unique to Los Angeles,\" said John A. Arguelles, vice\\nchairman of the 10-member Independent Commission on the Los\\nAngeles Police Department.\\n\\nAmong the commission\\'s recommendations are:\\n\\n-- A commission appointed by the mayor that oversees the\\ndepartment should be reorganized and strengthened, and made\\nresponsible for handling citizen complaints. It also should\\nbe \"reconstituted\" with members not linked with the current\\ncontroversy, in the interest of a \"fresh start.\"\\n\\n-- A \"major overhaul\" of the police disciplinary system\\nand the process used by citizens to file complaints against\\nLAPD officers, especially in excessive force cases, is\\nneeded. The current system is \"skewed against complainants,\"\\nby allowing officers\\' station-house colleagues to investigate\\ncomplaints, perpetuating a \"code of silence\" among officers.\\n\\n-- A new community-based police force should focus on\\n\"service to the public and prevention of crime\" as primary\\ntasks rather than amassing arrest statistics.\\n\\nHowever, the commission didn\\'t address how Los Angeles\\nwould pay for this major overhaul, though Mr. Christopher\\nsaid that \"when you see the costs of settlements\\naccelerating\" in police misconduct lawsuits as they have in\\nrecent years, \"I\\'m not sure there will be a net cost\"\\nincrease to implement the changes.\\n\\nBut with the city still sharply divided over the future of\\nChief Gates, and a general feeling that taxes are high enough\\nalready, it\\'s questionable whether there will be a popular\\ngroundswell to immediately fund changes. Over the years, the\\ncity council and the mayor have been reluctant to even add\\nadditional officers to the LAPD. Of the six largest police\\ndepartments in the U.S., the nation\\'s second largest city has\\nthe fewest officers per thousand residents. There are 8,450\\nofficers here for more than 3.5 million people; Chicago, with\\na smaller population, has 12,000.\\n\\nHowever, Michael Yamaki, one of the city\\'s five police\\ncommissioners, believes that given the systemic problems in\\nthe department that have come to light, \"citizens now will be\\nmore willing to fund police issues.\"\\n\\nThe commission\\'s recommendations will now be reviewed by\\nthe City Council, which will weigh whether to adopt them in\\nwhole or in part. Ultimately, voters must decide several\\nissues, including whether to set term limits on the chief\\'s\\ntenure. The commission intends to reconvene in six months to\\nassess the progress.\\n\\nEven before the commission\\'s report was issued, community\\ngroups that monitor the LAPD noted a decline in brutality\\ncomplaints.\\n\\nThe harsh tone of the report was welcome vindication for\\ncommunity leaders who have claimed that police brutality is\\nwidespread.

He\\nadded that he has worked on his own to accomplish some of\\nwhat the commission suggested, but has often been stymied by\\nbudget cuts.\\n\\nAs for the recommendation that he step down, the embattled\\nchief said he will wait until the voters sanction a move to\\nlimit a police chief\\'s tenure.\\n\\nOverall, Chief Gates added, \"It\\'s a good report.

The number of deaths increased at an even greater rate of 41 percent. The State Tuberculosis and Lung Center said that poor socioeconomic conditions could account for the increase. Latvia does not have a law that would require mandatory treatment for infectious cases of tuberculosis. The Department of Health submitted a proposal for such a law but no action has been taken. There are 11 state tuberculosis hospitals in Latvia that provide free care for those with active cases.\\nIntroduction:\\nCSO \\n\\nRiga, Feb.4. There has been an increase in \\ntuberculosis morbidity and mortality during the past year. In \\ncomparison with 1992, tuberculosis morbidity has increased by \\n14.8%, and mortality -- by 44%. The total number of \\ntuberculosis cases in 1993 was 868, while in the 1992 -- it was \\n771. \\n  Inta Pavlovska, director of the data processing and registry \\ndivision of the State Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Center \\ninformed DIENA that the increase in tuberculosis morbidity could \\nbe related to the poor socioeconomic conditions in the nation, \\nas well as shortcomings in the legislative process. At the \\npresent time, there are no laws in Latvia that would require \\ninfectious cases of tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment. \\n  In November of the past year, the Department of Health of \\nthe \\nMinistry of Welfare submitted a medical legislative proposal to \\nthe Cabinet of Ministers, which would require infectious cases \\nof tuberculosis to undergo mandatory treatment, explained I. \\nPavlovska. To this day, the proposal to the Cabinet of Ministers \\nhas still not been reviewed. \\n  At present, Latvia has 11 state tuberculosis hospitals, \\nproviding treatment for tuberculosis cases free of charge. The \\nnewest of these -- Ceplisi (in Ogre rayon), only started \\noperations in January of this year. Most of the patients \\nthere, however, are chronic alcoholics who suffer from \\ntuberculosis. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nCentral American and Caribbean governments await a US statement on Caribbean basin market protection in the US and Canada, promised by President Clinton in talks last year. Regional leaders fear Mexico could capture Caribbean-developed markets and investments could be diverted to Mexico. Also, parity for a few exports would come at the price of investment treaties, intellectual property and workers\\' rights agreements, environmental legislation, democracy, etc. A de facto extension of NAFTA is unlikely, given the opposition to the original NAFTA. Some US congressmen propose putting all regional exports on a par with Mexico\\'s for three years while future trade relationships are negotiated.\\nIntroduction:\\nCentral American and Caribbean governments are awaiting with more than\\npassing interest an imminent US statement on measures to cushion the\\neconomic dislocation which the region expects from the North American Free\\nTrade Agreement.\\nHowever, Washington\\'s proposals, promised by Mr Alexander Watson, assistant\\nsecretary of state for inter-American affairs, are likely to disappoint\\nCaribbean basin governments which have been seeking a comprehensive package\\nto allow free access to the US and Canadian markets. The US proposals could\\nalso be \\'at a cost\\' to the region, say some Caribbean officials.\\nClaiming that a more competitive Mexico, with free access to the US and\\nCanada, will capture markets which Caribbean basin countries have developed\\nunder current trade agreements, the region has asked for \\'parity\\' with\\nMexico in exporting to Nafta signatories.\\nSome regional government officials and US legislators supportive of the\\nCaribbean\\'s concerns - which include the possible diversion of investments\\nto Mexico - have now concluded that what would amount to a de facto\\nextension of Nafta is unlikely. They believe that the US administration\\nwould not again willingly confront the coalition of opposition which fought\\nthe implementing legislation last November.\\nThe measures to be announced by the US are a result of discussions last year\\nbetween President Bill Clinton and leaders from the Caribbean and Central\\nAmerica. Mr Clinton and his Mexican counterpart, Mr Carlos Salinas, assured\\nthe Caribbean basin countries that they would not be adversely affected by\\nthe implementation of Nafta, and that efforts would be made to protect their\\nmarkets in the US and Canada.\\nWhat the Caribbean basin countries want is quick action by legislators in\\nWashington, and then in Ottawa and Mexico City, to ratify proposals by some\\nUS congressmen to put all the region\\'s exports to the US and Canada on a par\\nwith Mexico\\'s.\\nThe parity proposals are aimed at giving Caribbean basin countries an open\\ndoor to the Nafta market for three years. During this time they would have\\nthe opportunity of negotiating their future trade relationship with the\\nNafta signatories, with the option of seeking membership either as\\nindividual states or as a group.\\n\\'President Clinton has said his administration will ensure that the benefits\\nof Nafta are felt by the Caribbean countries,\\' said Mr Manuel Esquivel,\\nprime minister of Belize. \\'We are heartened by President Salinas\\' assurances\\nthat it is not Mexico\\'s intention to take investments away from the\\nCaribbean. But we remain apprehensive.\\'\\nThere is yet no indication of what the US administration will propose for\\nthe Caribbean basin. Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary-general of the Caribbean\\nCommunity (Caricom), said he expected parity to be given to \\'only a few\\' of\\nthe region\\'s exports, including textiles.\\n\\'The parity issue, which is the first step we are seeking, is becoming a\\ncase of limited benefits for a very great price,\\' he said. While willing to\\ngive parity to a few products, the US wanted the Caribbean basin countries\\nto meet new conditions, including bilateral investment treaties,\\nintellectual property rights agreements, workers\\' rights and environmental\\nlegislation, democracy, good governance and accountability, Mr Carrington\\nsaid.\\n\\'The costs of parity are much higher than we anticipated and any thoughts of\\nfull membership of Nafta are as far down the road as they ever were.\\'\\nIn presenting their case for parity, Caribbean leaders have argued that the\\nUS and Canada will also be the losers if there is extensive economic\\ndislocation in the region caused by a loss of markets to Mexico. Mr P J\\nPatterson, Jamaica\\'s prime minister, claimed that many jobs in the US\\ndepended on trade flows between that country and the Caribbean region.\\n\\'Each Dollars 1bn of US exports to the region creates 20,000 new jobs in the\\nUS,\\' he said. \\'In the past 10 years US exports to the Caribbean basin have\\ndoubled, making the region the tenth largest market for US exporters. As\\nCaribbean economies grow our ability to absorb US exports will also\\nincrease.\\n\\'Currently 60 cents of every dollar earned by the Caribbean returns to the\\nUS through the purchase of US goods, compared with only 10 cents for each\\ndollar spent by Asia. This is why we must pursue efforts to ensure that the\\nquestion of the granting of parity be given early and positive\\nconsideration.\\'\\nWithout improved access to the US and Canadian markets to counter Mexico\\'s\\nbenefits under Nafta, the Caribbean basin countries will have to continue\\ndepending on their current trade preference agreements with the US and\\nCanada.\\nThe benefits from these were diminishing, said Mr Carrington, as the\\nregion\\'s exports became less competitive and Mexican products enjoyed the\\nbenefits of the market.\\n\\'The Nafta playing field will never be level for the region,\\' he said.\\n\\'Nobody is going to give us an even playing field, but we have to work to\\nmake it less uneven.\\'\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe National Centers for Disease Control reported data on tuberculosis showing 7,720 new cases in whites, 8,289 in blacks, 3,367 in Hispanics and another 2,371 in Asians and Pacific Islanders. This represents a reversal in a trend in which tuberculosis was declining. Much of the regression is caused by the occurrence of tuberculosis in AIDA patients. Tuberculosis was up 9.1 percent in blacks and 17.6 percent in Hispanics, two groups with proportionally higher rates of AIDS. More than 115,00 Americans were being treated for tuberculosis, about 20,000 new patients and another 20,00 labeled high risk and in preventive therapy.\\nIntroduction:\\n   A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but\\nstopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected,\\nfederal health researchers say.\\n   In 1988, the last year for which complete statistics are\\navailable, 22,436 U.S. tuberculosis cases were reported, down 0.4\\npercent from 1987, the national Centers for Disease Control\\nreported Thursday. That slight drop compares with an average annual\\ndecrease of 6.7 percent from 1981 to 1984.\\n   One reason for the slowing of progress in wiping out TB is ``the\\nincreasing occurrence of TB in persons infected with ... HIV,\\'\\' the\\nvirus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the CDC said.\\n   AIDS leaves the body susceptible to a number of serious\\nillnesses, including TB, and studies have found that about 4\\npercent of AIDS patients also are listed as TB patients.\\n   If the 6.7 percent average annual decline had kept up through\\nthe late 1980s, an estimated 14,768 fewer TB cases would have been\\nexpected during 1985-1988, the CDC said in its weekly report.\\n   Tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988, as\\ncompared with 1985, but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6\\npercent among Hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higher\\nrates of AIDS cases.\\n   In 1988, 7,720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites,\\ncompared with 8,280 in blacks and 3,637 in Hispanics. The TB rate\\namong blacks was 28.3 per 100,000, compared with 18.3 for Hispanics\\nand 4.1 for whites. Another 2,371 TB cases were reported among\\nAsians and Pacific Islanders in the United States, for a rate of\\n36.3 per 100,000.\\n   The CDC estimates that 10 million Americans are infected with\\nthe bacteria that cause tuberculosis, an infection of the lungs.\\nThe vast majority will never become ill.\\n   But the number of new cases is only part of the toll from\\ntuberculosis, the CDC said. In 1987, more than 115,000 Americans\\nwere under TB treatment: 20,000 new patients plus 95,000 people\\nlabeled high-risk and on preventive therapy.\\n   Tuberculosis, which is curable in most cases with drug\\ntreatment, killed 1,755 Americans in 1987.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nClarence Thomas was born 43 years ago in a rural area near Savannah. His father deserted the family, and Clarence was raised by his maternal grandparents. Under the direction of his grandfather and the nuns who schooled him, he learned sharecropping, scholarship, and hard labor. He was later impressed by Thomas Sowell, a prominent black economist, who advised blacks to pursue economic independence rather than political agitation. He developed into a hybrid product of harsh Southern history and baby-boomer ambition, and a proponent of strength over dependence. His black conservatism made him a favorite of Republican administrations.\\nIntroduction:\\nFire long ago destroyed the house where Clarence Thomas spent his boyhood. But\\nnearby, down a woodsy, one-lane, white-sand road outside Savannah, Ga., sits a\\nreminder of what might have been -- the tired cottage where his sister still\\nlives, by a broad, shining marsh called Moon River.\\nDown shore sits the\\ndefunct packing factory where his family and most of the rest of the people in\\nthe semirural cluster of houses and trailer-homes known as Pin Point used to\\npick the meat from crabs and chop the heads off shrimp.  \\n\\nThere, in the segregated black Georgia of four decades past, began the\\ntoughening of Clarence Thomas, nominee to the United States Supreme Court.\\nAbandoned by his father, driven by his hard-eyed grandfather and a band of\\nnuns sent south to teach black children, young Clarence learned sharecropping\\nand scholarship, hard labor and the Latin mass, and how to survive the walk\\nhome through black Savannah in his Catholic school uniform.\\nFrom these\\nroots, he might have become one of any number of bright, activist black men to\\nrise out of Southern poverty and press a politically aggressive liberal agenda\\nof civil rights and affirmative action -- as did men like Thurgood Marshall,\\nthe retiring justice whose Supreme Court seat Thomas might take.\\nInstead,\\nThomas, now 43, became something else -- a hybrid product of harsh Southern\\nhistory and baby-boom ambition, a proponent of personal strength over\\ndependence, of individualism over government activism.\\nBy the time he\\narrived in Washington with the Reagan administration, he had developed into a\\nrare breed -- a black conservative so impressive to Republican presidents that\\nhe was set on the road to the highest court in the land. But he was so\\ndisturbing to traditional liberals that they are eager to deprive him of\\nSenate confirmation in September.\\nHistorically, trying to predict Supreme\\nCourt nominees has been extremely risky. Still, many liberals are convinced\\nthat Thomas\\' past clearly shows his future. He would, they say, oppose\\nabortion rights, school busing plans and affirmative action programs. He would\\nalso weaken the wall separating government and religion and further restrict\\nthe rights of criminal suspects and defendants.\\nNot surprisingly, Thomas\\'\\nmany friends and supporters draw different conclusions. They see him as an\\nindependent spirit, a probable centrist on a court that has been steering\\nrightward for several years.\\nThe Georgia beginning\\nBut any attempt to\\nunderstand the potential successor to the revered Thurgood Marshall must begin\\nin Georgia.\\nThere, just the other day, Leola Williams, Thomas\\' mother,\\ntalked about how the force of family worked on her son:\\n\"Clarence was\\nsurrounded by all our older parents. He saw how our family and other people\\nstruggled to make a living.\\n\"I guess Clarence wanted to prove to himself\\nhe could be what he wanted to be -- and prove to his grandfather he could be\\nthe kind of person (his grandfather) wanted him to be.\"\\nThe grandfather,\\nthe late Myers Anderson, began training Thomas in earnest when the boy was 9\\nand Leola Williams\\' life suddenly began coming apart. Her house off Pin Point\\nAvenue had gone up in smoke, and some months later, her husband went north to\\nPhiladelphia, leaving her with two young children and a third on the way.\\nWilliams took her daughter, Emma Mae, and moved in with an aunt while she\\nawaited the birth of her second son, Myers. Clarence went to live with his\\ngrandparents in Savannah, to help with Anderson\\'s year-round oil and ice\\ndelivery business.\\nHis grandfather proved to be a profound force in\\nThomas\\' life -- a mentor, a role model, an unrelenting taskmaster and the\\nembodiment of a personal philosophy that Thomas once recalled this way:;   \\n\"He used to tell me that there was no problem that elbow grease couldn\\'t\\nsolve. Then he\\'d say, \\'Old Man Can\\'t is dead. I helped bury him.\\' \"\\nWhen\\nAnderson wasn\\'t coaching Thomas, in his farm fields or on his delivery truck,\\nhe made sure the lessons continued, in the hands of the Franciscan nuns of\\nall-black St. Benedict the Moor School.\\nThomas, who had experienced racial\\nmistreatment by white seminarians in Georgia, ultimately rejected seminary\\nlife. He has identified an episode at Immaculate Conception Seminary in\\nConception, Mo., in 1968 as the final humiliation. He said he heard a\\nseminarian there react to the shooting of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by\\nsaying, \"Good, I hope the son of a bitch dies.\"\\nThomas left the seminary\\nand went north to enroll at Holy Cross College in the gritty New England\\nfactory city of Worcester, Mass.\\nA Southerner in New England\\nThe\\nSouthern farm boy was forced to endure not only the harsh winters of New\\nEngland, but also the chilly atmosphere of a white college just beginning to\\nwiden opportunities for blacks.\\nWithin days of King\\'s assassination, the\\nschool created a scholarship fund named after the civil-rights leader and\\nstepped up the recruiting of blacks. And so Thomas, who was driven from the\\nMissouri seminary by racism, became one of the beneficiaries of an effort to\\ncombat it.\\nThomas, who paid for his college education with loans, jobs and\\nthe newly raised scholarship funds, soon was drawn into the turbulence of\\nVietnam War and \"black power\" politics.\\nHe helped found a Black Student\\nUnion, writing and typing its constitution. In December 1969, he and other\\nblack students resigned to protest the suspensions of black students who had\\nblocked a General Electric recruiter on campus. Stung, school officials\\ngranted a blanket amnesty and the students returned.\\nThomas went on to run\\ntrack and write for the campus newspaper. He graduated from Holy Cross with\\nhonors and left for Yale University Law School in New Haven, Conn.\\nFreewheeling liberalism\\n\"He came into law school espousing liberal views\\nfrom his freewheeling, unattached undergraduate days,\" said Harry Singleton, a\\nblack classmate, close friend and a former civil rights official in the Reagan\\nEducation Department.\\n\"But he became more conservative as he went through\\nthe process of legal education.\"\\nYale law students, Singleton explained,\\nwere exposed to conservative law professors with powerful minds.\\n\"I used\\nto discuss conservative ideas with Clarence and he was interested in them,\"\\nSingleton said. \"They were about the dangers of big government trying to solve\\nall the ills of society and how every time you do that you take away from the\\nliberties of the people.\"\\nBut it was Thomas Sowell, the conservative black\\neconomist now at Stanford University\\'s Hoover Institution, whose work came to\\ngrip Thomas\\' mind.\\nShortly after his arrival at Yale, Thomas remembered\\nwhen someone gave him one of Sowell\\'s books and \"I threw it in the trash\"\\nbecause \"it really went against all the things we\\'d been indoctrinated to\\nbelieve about the radical movement and the peace movement.\"\\nBut after law\\nschool, Thomas rediscovered one of Sowell\\'s books. Sowell\\'s provocative 1983\\nwork, \"The Economics and Politics of Race,\" was \"manna from heaven,\" Thomas\\nsaid.\\nIn that book, Sowell, arguing from a laissez-faire perspective,\\nendorsed the notion that blacks would benefit more from pursuing economic\\nachievement than political agitation.\\nFrom Yale to Washington\\nThomas,\\nalways a top student, was recruited out of Yale in 1974 by John Danforth,\\nR-Mo., then Missouri attorney general, a Yale trustee and a frequent campus\\nvisitor. Danforth brought Thomas to Jefferson City, Mo., to work in the\\nattorney general\\'s office.\\nWhen Danforth became a U.S. senator in 1977,\\nThomas stayed in St. Louis to work as an assistant counsel for the Monsanto\\nCorp., then in 1979 joined Danforth in Washington as a legislative aide.\\nReagan administration officials were so impressed by Thomas and his new\\nconservative leanings that they appointed him assistant secretary for civil\\nrights in the Department of Education. In 1982, they promoted him to the more\\nvisible post of chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. There\\ncontroversy dogged him for the next eight years.\\nCongress learned in 1989\\nthat the EEOC under Thomas\\' direction had permitted more than 13,000 age\\ndiscrimination claims to lapse.\\nCivil-rights groups accused Thomas of\\nfailing to enforce other anti-discrimination laws as well, and of retaliating\\nagainst employees who disagreed with his policies.\\nThomas concentrated on\\nwinning relief for victims of actual discrimination. He steered away from\\nlawsuits based on statistical evidence and remedies that included timetables\\nfor future hiring.\\nBut he was unwilling to go along with more strident\\nvoices in the Reagan administration who opposed most legal remedies for\\ndiscrimination, so he often felt isolated from both the administration and the\\ncivil rights establishment.\\nSeveral years ago, a top Reagan domestic\\nadviser who wanted his coffee cup refilled at a black-tie dinner looked up and\\nspotted a black man in a tuxedo hovering near the table. Holding the cup\\naloft, the official asked for more coffee. The black man reached past the cup\\nto shake hands and said evenly: \"Perhaps we haven\\'t met.

Although the British government insists that the incurable disease poses only a remote risk to human health, scientists are not sure what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. It has symptoms similar to scrapie, a disease long observed in sheep, eating holes in the brains of its victims and in its late stages causing an animal to stagger drunkenly. There are two human forms of spongiform encephalopathy: Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease and kuru.\\nIntroduction:\\n   ``Mad cow disease\\'\\' has killed 10,000 cattle,\\nrestricted the export market for Britain\\'s cattle industry and\\nraised fears about the safety of eating beef.\\n   The government insists the disease poses only a remote risk to\\nhuman health, but scientists still aren\\'t certain what causes the\\ndisease or how it is transmitted.\\n   ``I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,\\'\\' says Martin\\nRaff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. ``But they\\ncertainly are not zero.

Clean-up from the spill continued as the oil slick was estimated to affect an area the size of Delaware. Alaska Governor Cowper said the coast Guard could better handle the clean-up than Exxon. James Hazelwood, captain of the Valdez, who had been found to be legally drunk and was fired by Exxon, surrendered to police in a Long Island suburb of New York City. Released on $500,000 bail he may not waive extradition to Alaska.\\nIntroduction:\\nExxon salvage crews successfully refloated the stricken tanker Exxon Valdez on \\nWednesday as the former captain of the vessel surrendered to authorities in New \\nYork to face criminal charges in the massive oil spill. \\n\\nJoseph Hazelwood, 42, surrendered to police in a Long Island suburb of New York \\nCity and hours later Judge Kenneth Rohl set bail at $500,000 -- 10 times what \\nAlaskan authorities had sought. \\n\\nHazelwood\\'s lawyer said he had not decided whether to waive extradition \\nproceedings and return to Alaska to face the charges; Hazelwood was not \\nrequired to enter a plea Wednesday. \\n\\n\\nFired by Exxon \\n\\nAfter the Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24, Hazelwood was found to be \\nlegally drunk and was fired by Exxon. Hazelwood left Alaska before local \\nauthorities could interview him, and had been pursued since Saturday on a \\nfugitive warrant on three misdemeanor charges: operating a watercraft while \\nintoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil at sea. \\n\\nTogether, those three charges have a maximum penalty of 27 months in prison and \\na $10,000 fine. \\n\\n\"These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been equaled, at \\nleast in this country,\" Rohl said. \"We have a man-made destruction that has not \\nbeen equaled, probably, since Hiroshima.\" \\n\\nFBI officials in Washington say they also are investigating whether Hazelwood \\ncould be charged with felony violations of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits \\nnegligent discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. \\n\\nNo people have been killed or even seriously injured by the spill, but oil has \\nseriously disrupted the rich Prince William Sound fishing industry. Also, \\nanimal-rescue teams estimate the spill has killed several thousand birds and \\nhundreds of sea otters. \\n\\nEstimates of wildlife deaths are not easy to make because oiled birds are hard \\nto spot from the air, and many beaches are difficult to reach for in person \\ninspections. \\n\\nIn the wildlife-rich sound, cleanup crews continued to skim emulsified oil as \\nthick as pudding. As of Wednesday, 12 days after the Exxon Valdez ran aground, \\nthe 240,000-barrel slick was estimated to affect an area the size of Delaware, \\nand Exxon\\'s fleet of oil-skimming boats had picked up only about 5% of the \\nspilled oil. \\n\\nThe state of Alaska condemned Exxon\\'s cleanup on Wednesday and asked the Coast \\nGuard to take over the effort. Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), a senior member \\nof the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee added during a tour of \\nPrince William Sound that fraud \"is not too strong a word to describe Exxon\\'s \\ncleanup claims.\" \\n\\n\"What they are really doing is managing the failure,\" Miller said after meeting \\nwith Aleut Indian residents in the tiny fishing village of Chenega Bay. \\n\\nAlaska Gov. Steve Cowper said the Coast Guard should be better able to handle \\ncoordination and management of the cleanup than Exxon, which he said was too \\nbureaucratic. \\n\\n\"Maybe that\\'s been the problem all along. You need a military system to get \\nthings done,\" the governor said. \\n\\nAlthough Cowper said he did not want to be \"extremely critical\" of Exxon, a \\nletter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmental official said Exxon had \\nbeen unresponsive. \\n\\n\"Exxon has failed to provide . . . the information necessary to make sound \\nplanning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil and the protection of \\nresources,\" wrote Lynn Kent, chief of the state Oil and Hazardous Substance \\nSpill Response Section. \\n\\nPresident Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level officials to Valdez and \\ndetermined that federal management of the cleanup was not necessary. Rear Adm. \\nEdward Nelson Jr., commander of the Coast Guard\\'s 17th District in Juneau had \\nno immediate reply to Cowper\\'s request. \\n\\nExxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company disagreed with charges it was \\nnot handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxon was the best organization \\nto manage the effort. \\n\\n\"We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup. We think the most \\neffective and efficient way to carry out this project is (for Exxon) to \\ncontinue,\" Beathard said. \\n\\nThe tanker refloat went unexpectedly well. The 987-foot ship lifted off the \\nreef three hours earlier than the Exxon salvage crew predicted, proceeding \\nwithout problem under close watch of a flotilla of six tugs and other support \\ncraft, including the Coast Guard Cutter Rush, to a cove on uninhabited Naked \\nIsland 25 miles to the southwest, where repairs will be made. \\n\\nEven though a relatively well-known salvage technique was used to float the \\nValdez -- using compressed air to force water out of the ruptured hold and thus \\nassist high tide in lifting the vessel off the rocks -- \"we couldn\\'t predict \\nthis by the exact hour or minute,\" said salvage coordinator Gary Gorski, who \\nsupervised from the ferry Glacier Queen II. \\n\\nAlmost 1 million barrels of oil were pumped from the Exxon Valdez to three \\nsmaller tankers over the last 11 days, and the salvage process began as soon as \\nthe last of the tankers left for Southern California refineries on Tuesday. The \\nship was made airtight above the water line, and then, on Wednesday, compressed \\nair was forced inside. \\n\\nThe air forced out some of the 998,000 barrels of sea water that had been \\npumped into the stricken tanker as oil was removed. \\n\\nNaval architect Richard Smith, hired by Exxon, estimated before the refloat \\nthat the pressure would force enough water out of the hull to lift the ship at \\nleast three feet. He added that this technique also would produce a pressurized \\nbuffer of clean sea water between the oil left in the tanker -- about 15,000 to \\n20,000 barrels -- and the once-pristine waters off Valdez. \\n\\nEven so, Exxon officials warned in advance that refloating the ship could \\nuncover additional oil that had been pinned in pockets between the ship\\'s hull \\nand rocky Bligh Reef. \\n\\nThe Port of Valdez was closed at 10 a.m. to clear the iceberg-dotted waters of \\nother vessels as the refloating was attempted and Coast Guard spokesman Bruce \\nPimental said that the vital oil terminal would remain closed until the \\nstricken tanker was safely anchored. \\n\\nHowever, flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to its normal daily flow of \\n2.1 million barrels Wednesday, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said. Oil flow \\nfrom the North Slope had been cut by 60% because the spill restricted tanker \\ntraffic in Valdez harbor, but traffic has increased. \\n\\nGorski said that the ease with which the refloat was accomplished may indicate \\nthat the damage, while severe, may not be as bad as earlier feared. \\n\\nExxon officials were reluctant to estimate how long temporary repairs would \\ntake or discuss where the tanker would be taken to permanently patch its hull \\nand rebuild its internal pumping system, which also was compromised in the \\naccident. \\n\\nPortland, Ore., was the company\\'s first choice, but it backed away from that \\noption after Oregon Gov. Neil E. Goldschmidt and managers of the Port of \\nPortland expressed concern that the Exxon Valdez would still be leaking oil \\nwhen it arrived there. \\n\\nAlready under attack by Gov. Cowper for fouling Prince William Sound, Exxon \\nsaid it would consider having the tanker repaired in the Far East -- Japan, \\nKorea or Singapore. \\n\\nEven as it made that concession, the company denied its ship would endanger any \\nport it visited for repair. \\n\\nStaff writer Larry B. Stammer in Valdez contributed to this report. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nBefore Slovenia declared independence, any foreign exchange deposits which Yugoslav citizens deposited in Slovenian banks were transferred to the former National Bank of Yugoslavia (NBY).

Many believe the House of Representative\\'s Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987 fails to do that. It proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, most to expand existing welfare programs. Proponents say the new money is an investment, that some money will go to new programs to induce welfare recipients off the rolls and into jobs. Detractors say it amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nHow much more of an \"investment\" should American taxpayers make in the welfare system? \\nThis is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987. \\nThe bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients. \\n\\n\\nIt appears that what we have here is something of a Trojan horse -- a piece of legislation that is represented as \"reform\" when all it does is expand existing welfare programs. \\nThe bill\\'s questionable premise is that larger expenditures on welfare will reduce welfare dependency. \\nThis thinking was nicely summarized by Rep. Anthony Beilenson, who said plainly, \"The truth is, for welfare reform to be successful, it\\'s got to be expensive.\" \\n\\n\\nThe proposed new spending on welfare should be viewed as an investment, say its proponents, led by Rep. Thomas Downey. \\nThey point out that part of the money will go for special education, training and work programs for welfare mothers, to induce them off the rolls and into jobs. \\nAt the same time they say, certain existing benefits -- mainly Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) -- must be increased to offset real declines since the base year of 1970. \\n\\n\\nHouse members on both sides of the aisle agree that welfare-to-work programs are worthwhile. \\nThat conclusion was presumably the basis for the bipartisan consensus that was going to produce a serious welfare-reform bill this year. \\nBut less than a quarter of the $5.2 billion outlay would go for that purpose. \\nThe bulk of the new money would go to higher AFDC pay-outs, extension of mandatory benefits to two-parent families and maintenance of certain benefits for welfare recipients earning some income. \\nIn short, the Family Welfare Reform Act amounts to an expanded investment in the status quo. \\n\\n\\nOf course, House Democrats could hardly promote this bill as more of the same. \\nThat might produce reprisals from voters who\\'ve watched their tax dollars build and maintain the welfare system, with little evident return on their investment. \\nInstead, after nearly 20 years, the system\\'s defenders and funders repeatedly tell the public that the problem, if anything, has gotten worse. \\nSo the House\\'s liberal majority hoped to achieve an increase in welfare outlays by making a bow to \"reform.\" \\n\\n\\nIn fact, while the level of AFDC benefits has decreased in real terms since 1970, the total level of all welfare benefits has not. \\nNearly all AFDC families also receive Medicaid coverage, for instance; more than three-quarters receive food stamps, and one-third have children who receive free school meals. \\nOne-quarter receive housing assistance. \\n\\n\\nTogether, spending for the seven major welfare programs (those just mentioned plus the Women, Infants and Children program and the Low Income Energy Assistance program) has actually increased since 1970 by 232% in constant dollars, to an annual total $65.7 billion. \\nThe House Democrats\\' claim that welfare recipients are worse off than they were in 1970 -- in terms of the level of benefits received -- is dubious. \\n\\n\\nMeasured in the terms that really count -- namely the number of welfare dependents liberated from the rolls -- the situation has become worse. \\nDuring the unprecedented expansion of the welfare state, the most notable and highly publicized phenomenon has been the development of an entrenched class of long-term welfare dependents. \\nIt is difficult to accept that the $4.3 billion increase in basic benefits proposed in the Family Welfare Reform Act will do much of anything about the problem of hard-core welfare dependency. \\n\\n\\nAt the least, welfare reform should have these goals: to shrink rather than enlarge the welfare system, to ultimately eliminate perverse incentives to remain on welfare, and to make work the focus of the system. \\n\\n\\nThe House bill doesn\\'t do that. \\nBy adding several welfare programs to what already exists (without eliminating any), the House bill adds another layer to an already complex welfare system. \\nBy further increasing rather than gradually reducing the level of benefits available to recipients, it makes welfare more, not less, enticing. \\nBy diluting proposed work-for-welfare requirements, it diminishes the importance of work. \\n\\n\\nEarlier this year, there were hopeful signs that we would see sweeping, serious welfare-reform legislation emerge from Congress. \\nDemocrats and Republicans alike agreed on the need for change. \\nThis rare opportunity is being squandered. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Shining Path is now gaining support among farmers in the jungles of the Upper Huallaga Valley. From July 1984 to December 1985 this area was under a state of emergency and controlled by the army, which reportedly collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from drug lords. When President Garcia lifted the state of emergency, the army lost control and the Shining Path moved in. Reportedly, the guerrillas are demanding one-fifth of the farmer\\'s coca crop in return for protection. The Shining Path is organizing self-defense groups to oppose the anti-drug police and coca-eradication personnel.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nIn the late 1970s, poor farmers living in communities surrounding this small town began replacing their fields of cacao and coffee with coca to meet the growing U.S. demand for cocaine. \\nLike thousands of other farmers in Peru\\'s Upper Huallaga Valley, they discovered that while cacao and coffee could give their families enough to eat, coca could make them rich. \\nLately, someone else has been attracted by its big profits: the country\\'s murderous guerrillas, the Shining Path. \\nDevelopment workers, farmers and priests in the area say that the rebels have steadily streamed into the Upper Huallaga, a vast stretch of jungle northeast of Lima, and the biggest coca-growing zone in the world. \\n\\n\\nUntil recently, the Shining Path had largely neglected the jungle. \\nIn pursuing its strategy of trying to topple Peru\\'s democratically elected government, it had concentrated its bombings and shootings in the mountains and in Lima. \\nBut the guerrillas have discovered they can easily win support among farmers in the jungles of Upper Huallaga because of widespread anger generated by the U.S.-financed Peruvian anti-drug campaign. \\nThis effort focuses on interdicting drug trafficking and eradicating coca plants. \\n\\n\\nWhile Washington has been quick to trumpet links between guerrillas and drug trafficking in other countries, U.S. officials downplay the connection between drugs and the Shining Path. \\nOne reason is embarrassment that the U.S.-financed anti-drug effort may have pushed coca growers closer to the guerrillas. \\nBut more important, if it were admitted that guerrillas are in large numbers in the Upper Huallaga, the army might again be given emergency control over the zone. \\nAnd this is something Peruvian and U.S. officials apparently would rather avoid. \\n\\n\\nThe army was in force in the Upper Huallaga during the declared period of a state of emergency, from July 1984 to December 1985. \\nDuring this period, the army had virtual dictatorial control over all military and nonmilitary operations in the region. \\nGovernment officials from the anti-drug police (UMOPAR) and the coca-eradication unit (CORAH) sent into the region to wipe out drug production were often confined to their barracks by the army; they simply were not allowed to carry on with their work. \\nThe army continued its raids against the Shining Path in one part of the valley, but the drug growers were increasing production in several other parts while anti-drug officials were virtually kept under lock and key. \\nAnti-drug police, Upper Huallaga residents and Interior Ministry officials report that army officers received hundreds of thousands of dollars in payoffs from drug lords for their help in keeping anti-drug officials at bay. \\n\"It\\'s better for the \\'narcos\\' when the army is here,\" says one UMOPAR officer. \\n\\n\\nWhen new President Alan Garcia lifted the state of emergency, the army lost any ability it may have had to protect coca growers. \\nNot only did it lose the power of authority in the region, but the number of troops in the Upper Huallaga Valley was dramatically reduced. \\nThe troops were dispatched to other areas of the country, particularly in the mountainous Ayacucho region where guerrillas have been active. \\n\\n\\nWith the army impediment gone, the anti-drug campaign set about pushing traffickers out of Tingo Maria, their former headquarters, eliminating coca growing in the immediate vicinity of the town. \\nBut the narcos have now entrenched themselves in the towns of Tocache and Uchiza, where the police have repeatedly been blocked from entering by armed residents. \\nAt the same time, farmers are now planting coca in rugged parts of the jungle, far from CORAH\\'s sweep. \\n\\n\\nNevertheless, the loss of army protection provided the Shining Path with a golden opportunity. \\n\"The guerrillas now present themselves as the defenders of the coca farmers,\" says Segundo Ramirez, owner of Aucayacu\\'s radio station. \\nIn return for their protection, the guerrillas demand that farmers turn over one-fifth of their coca crop, according to UMOPAR officers, farmers and priests. \\nThe rebels then process the leaves into coca paste and sell the paste to international traffickers -- usually Colombians -- for weapons and money, local sources say. \\n\\n\\nThe commander of the anti-drug police, Gen. Juan Zarate, says there are few guerrillas in the Upper Huallaga and denies that an alliance exists between the drug traffickers and the Shining Path. \\nBut residents insist that the rebels operate as a de facto government in the zone, even in Aucayacu and Tulumayo, where the police and army have outposts. \\n\\n\\nAn important guerrilla activity is organizing community self-defense groups against the hated police. \\nTwenty-nine CORAH workers have been murdered in the valley since 1984, and it\\'s likely that the Shining Path will encourage this kind of violence. \\nIn early January, the rebels were apparently behind a strike protesting the anti-drug program. \\nFor three days they shut down the 50-mile road from Tingo Maria to Rio Uchiza -- the only continuous, paved road in the valley. \\n\\n\\nThe relationship between the Shining Path and the people of the valley is not entirely cordial. \\nAs part of its efforts to impart revolutionary \"justice\" among the people, the Shining Path has administered brutal reprisals against those peasants who do not fit its \"new-man\" profile. \\nDuring the January strike, the guerrillas killed an alleged thief and a seller of coca-paste cigarettes, according to a crop substitution program worker who works directly with the farmers in the area. \\nThe rebels are also believed responsible for the murders of four homosexual men last November in Aucayacu. \\nOn March 13 in El Triumfo, a small community near Aucayacu, they executed a 23-year-old man who spoke out against a guerrilla-organized activity. \\n\"That really shook up the 80 families in the community,\" says Enrique Pena, a parish priest who can no longer enter the guerrilla-controlled area. \\n\\n\\nThe guerrillas are held responsible for assassinating six mayors in the area since 1985, including two mayors from Aucayacu, which has 3,500 residents. \\nSays Aucayacu Deputy Mayor Luis Salazar: \"The captain of the army has told me I\\'m on the guerrillas\\' black list.\" \\n\\n\\nThe government\\'s problem in combatting the current violence and influence of the Shining Path is how to ensure that army troops sent into this coca-rich region won\\'t become corrupted by the lure of drug money, as they reportedly did in the past. \\nThis is the Catch-22 that now confounds Peruvian and U.S. officials trying to eradicate both drugs and guerrillas from Peru. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nPatience is a much-desired quality for the 26.2-mile runner. This was the case on Sunday during the Long Beach Marathon. The two winners, Rex Wilson of New Zealand and Wen Yanmin of China, waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun to take its toll. Wilson set a pace of 5 minutes per mile and took the lead at the 10-mile marker. At this pace, he set a course record. Yanmin, a student from Beijing, also set a course record. She had to overcome the lead of another runner in a close finish.\\nIntroduction:\\nPatience is often difficult to muster for those who run the 26.2 miles of a \\nmarathon. The tendency is to want to finish the race as soon as possible and \\nget a head start on recovering from it. \\n\\nPatience was its own virtue in the Long Beach Marathon Sunday, as the men\\'s and \\nwomen\\'s winners shrewdly waited for others to make mistakes and for the sun -- \\nwhich was obscured by cloud cover early in the race -- to burn through and take \\na toll on the runners. \\n\\nRex Wilson of New Zealand patiently waited for the lead pack to sort itself \\nout, took the lead at 10 miles and rolled to a victory in 2 hours 12 minutes 27 \\nseconds, a course record. The old record of 2:13:22 was set in 1986 by Ric \\nSayre. \\n\\nAmong the women, the race played itself out in a calm, if not orderly, fashion. \\nWen Yanmin, a 23-year-old student from Bejing, China, picked her way through a \\nstrung-out pack and out-kicked Laura Konatz of Toronto to win in 2:43:33, also \\na course record. Yanmin broke the old record of 2:44:51 set last year by Dianne \\nRodgers. \\n\\nRobert Molinatti of Huntington Beach won the wheelchair division in 1:47:59. \\n\\nRun as a race within a race was the Pacific Rim Marathon, which consists of \\nteams from invited countries. Wilson and Yanmin won both the Long Beach \\nMarathon and the Pacific Rim race, for total prize money of $9,500 each. \\n\\nConditions were excellent at the start of the race, which had its largest-ever \\nfield of 4,021 entrants. The weather for the first 1 1/2 hours was cloudy and \\ncool. But the mist burned off and the last eight miles -- the toughest portion \\nof the marathon -- became even tougher. The refrain from the runners was, \"It\\'s \\nnot the heat, it\\'s the humidity.\" \\n\\nThe men\\'s race was led at various times by a pack of about six runners. One by \\none they fell victim to the weather or other equally debilitating elements. \\nViktor Gural of the Soviet Union, who had been among the leaders for most of \\nthe race, said he had trouble with everything. Gural emphatically said it was \\ntoo hot, \"The sun went to work,\" was how he put it, and he said he experienced \\ntenderness in his liver during the race. American food also did not agree with \\nGural -- his stomach was upset. \\n\\nHe dropped from third to fifth in the race\\'s final stages. Samson Obwocha, a \\nKenyan who lives in Gardena, waited for Gural to fade and then made his move. \\n\\n\"I saw him struggling and I knew I could outkick him,\" Obwocha said. He did, \\nand finished fourth in 2:28.08. \\n\\nWilson also made a move, or more precisely, he continued his steady 5:03 mile \\npace while the rest of the field slowed from the early, faster pace. \\n\\n\"I didn\\'t really want to lead all the way,\" Wilson said. \"But I wanted to run \\nat 5-minute pace, so I had to lead.\" \\n\\nThe strategy resulted in a personal best time in only his third marathon -- an \\nevent he dislikes. \"I hate the marathon,\" Wilson, 28, said, sounding quite \\nsensible. \"At 21 miles I started to hurt. My legs were getting tired, my quads \\nwere getting tight. Those little bridges at the end were like mountains.\" \\n\\nStill, Wilson built a healthy lead on those \"mountains\" in Belmont Shores. \\nTomio Bueyoshi of Japan was second in 2:15:31 and Liu Wenzun of China was third \\nin 2:19:16. \\n\\nYanmin had to come from behind for her victory, giving the women\\'s race an \\nexciting finish. As happened in the men\\'s race, the runners in the lead pack \\nebbed and eventually faded. Guadalupe Roman of Mexico led through much of the \\nrace but lost ground steadily in the last five miles and finished sixth. Two \\nSoviet runners -- Irina Ruban and Tatiana Zueva -- who had run side-by-side in \\nthird and fourth place throughout the race, faded. Neither placed in the top \\n50. \\n\\nIt fell to Konatz, who had been in first and second throughout the race, to \\nhang in there. Even as the Chinese runner was bearing down on her as the finish \\nline came into sight. Konatz was happy with her second place time of 2:43:50. \\n\\nAsked if she was ever aware of Yanmin during the race, Konatz laughed. \\n\\n\"The marathon is an unpredictable event,\" she said. \"I knew at 25 miles if \\nsomeone had a good kick. . . . \" \\n\\nSomeone did.

The risk of contracting the disease by eating infected beef is considered minimal, but not non-existent. EU health ministers will discuss contaminated British beef on March 30. Meanwhile 50 cases of BSE have been recorded in Switzerland and two in Germany, one affecting a cow imported from Britain.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe German government yesterday announced the launch of a new research\\nproject to examine whether the cattle disease bovine spongiform\\nencephalopathy (BSE) can be transmitted to human beings.\\nThe initiative comes as the country is pushing for a European Union ban on\\nBritish beef imports, arguing that there is still no conclusive evidence\\nthat the disease cannot affect humans.\\nSeven German universities and research institutes will be sponsored by the\\ncountry\\'s research and technology ministry to examine possible connections\\nbetween the origins of BSE and two other diseases, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease\\nand Gerstmann Straussler syndrome, which very rarely affect humans.\\nSeveral German scientists have expressed concern that BSE - popularly known\\nas \\'mad cow disease\\' because of the way it debilitates the brains of cattle\\n -may be transmissible to humans who eat contaminated beef or take medicines\\nmade with ingredients from contaminated animals.\\n\\'The danger that BSE can be transmitted to humans is minimal or\\nnon-existent,\\' said Professor Hans Kretzschmar from Gottingen University.\\n\\'However, we do not know that it is non-existent.

Now critics are calling for the same kind of independent investigation of the sheriff\\'s department after sheriff\\'s deputies shot four people dead in the space of one month, three deputies were charged with stealing credit cards from elderly people, and there have been renewed charges that the department is home to white supremacist gangs. The FBI, Amnesty International and the county grand jury are investigation allegations about both the police and sheriff\\'s departments.\\nIntroduction:\\nFor months, this county\\'s politically astute Sheriff Sherman Block maintained\\na low profile for himself and his department while city police were being\\nhammered after the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King.\\nBut\\nthen sheriff\\'s deputies shot four people dead in the space of one month. The\\ncorruption case of an elite drug unit continued to make headlines. Three\\ndeputies were charged with stealing credit cards from elderly people. And\\nallegations that the department is home to white supremacist gangs resurfaced.  \\n\\nJust last week, a federal judge hearing a civil rights suit issued an\\nunusual order that employees follow department policy -- and the department\\nappealed, winning a temporary delay of the order.\\nThe spotlight that had\\nbeen trained on the police department and its 8,300 officers now has widened\\nto take in the equally large sheriff\\'s department. Block\\'s measured response\\nto the criticism -- and the lack of a riveting videotape -- have spared him\\nthe level of heat felt by Police Chief Daryl Gates. But after years of\\nboasting that their methods were models in policing, both departments are\\nfacing pressure to revolutionize their tactics to better fit this\\nfirst-of-its-kind metropolis.\\n\"We are a multiracial, multicultural city\\nmore than any other,\" said Ramona Ripston, head of the American Civil\\nLiberties Union of Southern California. \"If something can be worked out here,\\nit would be really, I think, a model that can be exported.\"\\nJoseph\\nMcNamara, retired chief of San Jose\\'s department and now a fellow at Stanford\\nUniversity\\'s Hoover Institution, said he has been getting calls all summer\\nfrom cities around the country about racism and brutality in their\\ndepartments.\\n\"There\\'s got to be a revolution in American policing,\"\\nMcNamara said. \"Militarizing police is a definite trend in the past 10 years,\\nand part of it is because of the Los Angeles models.\"\\nBut some observers\\nsay that, for a variety of political and social reasons, the possibility for\\nsubstantive change on L.A. law\\'s front lines is scant.\\nLow level of\\ninterest\\n\"There isn\\'t the level of interest among voting people, people\\nwith power, people with influence,\" ACLU spokesman Joe Hicks said. \"They don\\'t\\nreally care much about police reform. They just want to make sure their\\ncommunities are safe.\"\\nThe poor minority communities that do care suffer \"a\\nlack of organization that really can take advantage of the anger over the\\npolice and keep some momentum going that could potentially force reforms,\"\\nHicks said.\\nThe King beating led to an investigation of the police\\ndepartment by an independent commission that found racism, brutality,\\ninadequate discipline, mismanagement and a \"siege mentality\" pitting officers\\nagainst the community.\\nThe Christopher Commission\\'s scathing report made\\nmore than 100 recommendations, many of them aimed at moving away from the\\ndepartment\\'s \"hard-nosed\" approach and improving relations with residents.\\nAt the street level, it suggested officers spend more time out of their patrol\\ncars, work more with community groups and ease up on the common practice of\\nmaking suspects lie face down on the ground even when they pose no apparent\\nthreat.\\nThe city council is reviewing the recommendations, some of which --\\nfor instance, a term limit for the chief -- require voter approval.\\nNow,\\ncritics are calling for the same kind of independent investigation of the\\nsheriff\\'s department.\\nBut Block has dug in his heels, insisting a panel he\\nappointed is independent enough to advise which Christopher Commission\\nrecommendations might apply to his department. Critics say its leaders have\\nbeen supporters of the local law establishment.\\nBut because Block is\\nelected, his is the last word.\\nLike Gates before him, Block maintains his\\ndepartment is a good one with \"a reputation as being one of the most\\nprogressive, one of the most professional, one of the finest law enforcement\\nagencies.\"\\nThe sheriff has said that his department continually re-examines\\nitself and launched several Christopher Commission recommendations before the\\ncommission even existed -- but that it can\\'t do everything.\\n\\'A last-resort\\nmechanism\\'\\n\"Law enforcement, and I\\'m going beyond the sheriff\\'s department,\\ndid not create the social conditions out there from which the violence is\\nspringing,\" he said. \"People are looking at the criminal justice system today\\nas being the linchpins of government. . . . (But) We\\'re a last-resort\\nmechanism when other kinder and gentler processes fail in our society. And\\nfail they have.\"\\nBlock pointed to social ills including high drop-out and\\nilliteracy rates, \"young people who are raising themselves,\" and a county jail\\nsystem that is \"perhaps the major houser of mentally ill people in our society\\nin this nation.\"\\nCountywide, homicides soared to 1,964 last year, compared\\nwith 1,463 five years earlier.\\nThere are 950 known street gangs with more\\nthan 99,300 members in the county, according to the sheriff\\'s department.\\nAgreeing that law enforcement is not the answer to all of society\\'s failures,\\ncritics say Block is missing the point.\\n\"Police brutality (or) racism is\\nnot a social problem, it\\'s a law enforcement lack of leadership,\" the Hoover\\nInstitution\\'s McNamara said. \"The basic goal and mission of law enforcement\\npeople is to reduce conflict in the community. . . . The rhetoric of the Los\\nAngeles police establishment through the years seems to have escalated\\nconflict, not lowered it.\"\\nThe FBI, Amnesty International and the county\\ngrand jury are investigating allegations about both departments.\\nBut some\\ncritics are skeptical that the police culture here will change significantly.\\n  \\'Window dressing\\' predicted\\nOn the city side, they worry that the\\nChristopher Commission recommendations will be diluted by the time the city\\ncouncil and voters are finished with them.

They were flying from Hattiesburg to Gulfport after Smith had thrown out the first ball at the Dixie Youth World Series baseball tournament. The plane cut a swath 300 feet long through the woods where the wreckage was found. Searchers had spent all of Sunday night combing the woods, but the plane was finally spotted from the air. No cause has been determined. Smith was the second congressman in a week to die in a plane crash. Wreckage of Representative Mickey Leland\\'s plane was located on the same day Representative Smith was killed.\\nIntroduction:\\nFreshman congressman Larkin Smith (R-Miss.) died in a light plane crash in \\nMississippi, authorities said Monday, making him the second member of the House \\nkilled in an aviation accident in a week. \\n\\nThe single-engine Cessna 177 crashed Sunday night in thick woods near the tiny \\ncommunity of Janice. Smith and the pilot, Charles Vierling, who also was \\nkilled, were flying from Hattiesburg to Gulfport, according to federal and \\nlocal officials. \\n\\nSearchers combed the heavily wooded DeSoto National Forest through the night \\nbut were unable to find the wreckage until Monday morning, when they spotted it \\nfrom the air. \"There was a 300-foot-long path cut by the plane,\" Harrison \\nCounty Sheriff\\'s Department Capt. Rick Gaston said in a telephone interview. \\n\\nSmith, 45, died the same day the wreckage of a plane carrying Rep. Mickey \\nLeland (D-Tex.) and 15 others was found on an Ethiopian mountainside. Leland\\'s \\nplane had been missing almost a week after he took off on a fact-finding \\nmission to combat hunger. \\n\\nNews of Smith\\'s death was followed by an outpouring of sympathy from \\nMississippi to Washington, even as Smith\\'s colleagues were still mourning \\nLeland\\'s death. \\n\\nAt the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President and Mrs. Bush \\n\"deeply regret\" Smith\\'s death, adding that Smith, who was elected to a seat \\nvacated by Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), \"was just beginning a promising career in \\nthe Congress.\" \\n\\nSmith, a former sheriff and police chief, was already developing a reputation \\non the House Judiciary Committee as a zealous opponent of illegal drugs. \\n\\n\"We (the congressional delegation) had come to depend on him in the fight \\nagainst drugs,\" said Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.) \"This is a \\ntremendous loss to his family, his state, and the nation.\" \\n\\nSmith had thrown out the first ball at the Dixie Youth World Series baseball \\ntournament Sunday and was heading home to Gulfport, taking off at about 9:10 \\np.m. for the 35-minute flight. \\n\\nJack Barker, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman here, said the plane \\n\"lost radar contact\" at 9:25. He said area residents \"heard the airplane crash\" \\nand notified officials. Barker said visibility was 4 to 6 miles, and \"rain was \\nreported, but not heavy.\" \\n\\nLamar Breland told the Associated Press that \"my wife was preparing to go to \\nbed, and we heard a plane coming over. I thought at the time it was unusual for \\na plane to be in the area at night.\" He said he heard a \"revving sound and then \\na crash.\" \\n\\nIn Miami, Jorge Prellezo, regional director of the National Transportation \\nSafety Board, said a team of investigators had been dispatched to the scene. \\nInvestigators generally take months to establish a probable cause of such \\nincidents. \\n\\nThe plane belonged to the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies Inc. in Gulfport. \\nThe institute immediately issued a statement saying that Smith had requested \\nuse of the plane \"to accommodate his busy schedule.\" Jody Canady, a \\nspokeswoman, said Smith was to reimburse the institute. \\n\\nThe statement said the plane, manufactured in 1973, and purchased by the \\ninstitute last year, had a \"current inspection.\" The pilot received his license \\nin 1964 and had a physical examination on June 28, the statement said. \\n\\nSmith was elected last November to represent Mississippi\\'s 5th congressional \\ndistrict. He was Harrison County Sheriff from 1984 to 1989, and was Gulfport \\npolice chief from 1977 to 1983. As sheriff, Smith coordinated anti-drug efforts \\nof federal, local and state agencies across five states. \\n\\nSmith, survived by a wife and one child, was lauded by Mississippi Gov. Ray \\nMabus, who called his death \"a tragic loss\" for the state and ordered flags on \\nstate property flown at half staff. \\n\\nFriends and former associates in Gulfport were stunned and saddened. Gaston, \\nwho worked for Smith nine years both in the sheriff\\'s department and earlier \\nwhen Smith was Gulfport police chief, called Smith \"a pillar of strength.

The geological survey reported 61 significant quakes last year, including sites on the Nepal-Burma border, the Nepal-India border and the Burma-China border. The United States recorded three significant quakes, in the Gulf of Alaska, Whittier and Pasadena, California. Canada had one; Europe, Africa and Japan also recorded relatively minor quakes.\\nIntroduction:\\n   The earthquake that killed 25,000 people in\\nArmenia pushed last year\\'s earthquake-related death toll worldwide\\nto the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed at\\nleast 10 times as many, the U.S. Geological Survey reports.\\n   The estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an\\nadditional 2,000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around\\nthe world, the Survey reported Monday.\\n   Although the annual average death toll for earthquakes is about\\n10,000, in 1987 only 1,100 lives were lost.\\n   In addition to the deaths, some 13,000 people were injured and\\nmore than a half-million were left homeless in the Armenian\\nearthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale. The\\ndeath toll of 25,000 is the most recent reported by the Soviets. The\\nexact toll in unknown.\\n   The main shock was followed within minutes by a second, measuring\\n5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energy released by an\\nearthquake. An earthquake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage, and\\nthe strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale.\\n   Many of the deaths in Armenia were blamed on collapsing\\nbuildings, as the earthquake rattled concrete structures until they\\nfell to the ground, according to subsequent analyses.\\n   Another recent earthquake in the Soviet Union, claiming about\\n1,000 lives, struck in Soviet central Asia. That one occurred in\\nJanuary, however, and so does not count in the 1988 toll.\\n   Last year\\'s second most deadly earthquake occurred Aug. 20 on the\\nNepal-India border, killing 1,000. That earthquake, measuring 6.6 on\\nthe Richter scale, destroyed thousands of homes and injured many\\npeople.\\n   On Nov. 6 an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730\\nlives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma and\\nChina, the Geological Survey reported.\\n   And on the India-Burma border three deaths were reported in an\\nAug. 6 earthquake that caused landslides.\\n   The Survey said it recorded 61 significant earthquakes last year,\\n15 fewer than the year before. An earthquake is considered\\nsignificant if it has a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale.\\nEarthquakes of lesser magnitude are included if they cause\\ncasualties or considerable damage.\\n   Three significant earthquakes were recorded in the United States\\nlast year, including the strongest shock of the year. That\\nearthquake, measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska\\nand resulted in only minor damage.\\n   The only U.S. earthquake death last year occured when someone\\nsuffered a heart attack after an earthquake measuring 4.8 in\\nWhittier, Calif., in February. The other significant U.S. earthquake\\noccurred Dec. 3 in Pasadena, Calif. It was measured at 4.6 on the\\nscale and caused some injuries and property damage.\\n   An earthquake centered in eastern Canada on Nov. 25 was felt\\nwidely across that country and in the northeastern United States as\\nfar south as Washington, the Survey reported. It had a magnitude of\\n5.7. Earthquakes in the eastern part of North America tend to be\\nfelt over larger areas than earthquakes of similar strength in the\\nWest.\\n   Europe recorded three earthquake deaths last year when one rated\\nat 3.0 killed a group of miners in Czechoslovakia on Sept. 2.\\n   In addition an earthquake rated at 5.8 caused several injuries in\\nAlbania on Jan. 9.\\n   Injuries were also reported from two offshore earthquakes, one in\\nthe Ionian Sea near Greece Oct. 16 and another near the Azores\\nIslands Nov. 21.\\n   In Africa, eight people working in a gold mine in South Africa\\ndied Jan. 5 in an earthquake rated at 5.2.\\n   And Japan, usually very seismically active, recorded only one\\nsignificant earthquake last year, the Survey reported.

A US Fish and Wildlife Service representative said the 987-foot tanker was spilling oil at the rate of 10,000 barrels an hour. But a Coast Guard spokesman said that the spill had slowed to a trickle by afternoon Friday and did not seem to be moving ashore. Environmentalists feared that wildlife would be threatened, especially if the oil reached shore, and were concerned about the slow pace of the cleanup. Alaskan Governor Cowper arrived in Valdez on Friday to evaluate the spill.\\nIntroduction:\\nA Long Beach-bound Exxon oil tanker ran aground on a reef Friday and spilled an \\nestimated 8.4 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska\\'s Prince William Sound, \\na pristine Pacific waterway heavily used by kayakers, fishermen and tourists. \\nIt was the largest Alaskan oil spill ever. \\n\\nThe Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker owned by Exxon Shipping Co., rammed the \\nreef about 25 miles from the city of Valdez, the northernmost ice-free port in \\nthe United States, at 12:30 a.m. Coast Guard officers speculated that the \\nship\\'s captain may have been trying to avoid icebergs from the nearby Columbia \\nGlacier when the accident occurred. \\n\\n\\nLeak a Mere Trickle \\n\\nA representative of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said the tanker had been \\nspilling oil at a rate of 10,000 barrels an hour but the Coast Guard said the \\nleak had become a mere trickle by 2:30 p.m., Alaska time. \\n\\nU.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer John Gonzales said in a telephone interview from \\nValdez that the spill was staying \"in the mid-channel\" and did not seem to be \\nmoving toward the shore. \\n\\n\"We\\'ve had no report of any wildlife hurt at this time,\" he said. But \\nenvironmentalists feared that if the oil reached the shore, marine birds would \\nbe threatened. Herring hatch at this time of year and attract up to 20,000 sea \\nbirds for the feast. Environmentalists also expressed concern about whales, sea \\nlions and other wildlife. \\n\\nTwenty people were aboard the ship but there were no immediate reports of \\ninjuries, said Dave Parish, a spokesman for Exxon USA, in a telephone interview \\nfrom Anchorage. He said three planes from British Columbia, California and \\nEngland had been dispatched to the scene for aerial spraying to dilute the oil. \\n\\nGonzales said 200,000 barrels spilled into the sea. Another Exxon tanker was \\nattempting to pump the oil out of the crippled vessel, and two Coast Guard \\ninvestigators were on board the Valdez, he said. \\n\\nJon Nelson, a deputy regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in \\nAnchorage, said the reef ripped a 150-foot gash in the vessel, which was \\ncarrying 1.2 million barrels of oil, and there was fear that the tanker could \\nbreak apart further. \\n\\n\"If it breaks up on the rocks, then anything could happen,\" he said in a \\ntelephone interview. The seas were calm Friday and the forecast was for \\ncontinued calm until Sunday. \\n\\nInfuriated local residents and environmentalists complained about the slow pace \\nof the cleanup. \\n\\n\\nCritical of Efforts \\n\\n\"Where was the crackerjack response team that was supposed to be out there? \\nThey are moving way too slowly,\" said University of Alaska professor Richard \\nSteiner, who flew over the slick Friday. \"There (was) no oil (cleanup \\nequipment) out there and it\\'s been 14 hours since it happened. \\n\\n\"It is huge, literally huge,\" he said in a telephone interview from Cordova. \\n\"It looks devastating. The slick is probably five miles long by three miles \\nwide. Fortunately, there is no wind. . . . We saw six sea lions inside the \\nslick, swimming, trying to avoid it, and they had no idea which way to go.\" \\n\\nCindy Lowry, Alaska regional director for Greenpeace, also complained about the \\npace of the cleanup. \"It is more than 12 hours later and there is no (cleanup) \\nboom, no sweepers. They are bringing equipment from as far away as England. It \\nis just absurd that the equipment is not here already. . . . This will affect \\neverything in the food chain, from crab larvae to orca whales.\" \\n\\nExxon\\'s Parish said everything possible was being done. \"It takes time to get \\nactivated,\" he said. The immediate response to the spill was handled by crews \\nfrom the terminal at Valdez. \\n\\n\\nFloating Oil Booms \\n\\nGonzales, the Coast Guard spokesman, said the terminal has cleanup equipment on \\nsite for minor spills. He said employees of the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., \\nwhich operates the trans-Alaska oil pipeline for a consortium of oil companies, \\nwere getting floating oil booms in place by late afternoon. \\n\\nPrince William Sound, home to orcas, sea otters and fur seals, is important to \\nboth the fishing and the recreation industries. \\n\\n\"It\\'s a gorgeous marine environment and ecosystem, with lots of little islands \\nand inlets and bays,\" said Emily Barneet, Alaska issues specialist for the \\nSierra Club in Anchorage. \"It\\'s also a pretty well-established tourist \\nattraction, with sailing and glacier viewing trips. Prince William is a gem.\" \\n\\nThe spill is expected to add fuel to a campaign by environmentalists to prevent \\nfurther oil development in Alaska, particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife \\nRefuge. \"It\\'s of concern for two reasons: one is the size of the spill and that \\nthis is such a sensitive, very productive area,\" said Lisa Speer, senior staff \\nscientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. \"This is a \\nconsequence of North Slope oil development that is rarely mentioned.\" \\n\\nValdez City Manager Doug Griffen told the Associated Press that the 800-mile \\ntrans-Alaska pipeline, which carries oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez and the \\nmarine terminal, has a good environmental record. \\n\\n\\nExpected Worst \\n\\n\"But this could be a catastrophic occurrence, so we\\'re concerned,\" he said. \\n\"Living in Valdez, we\\'ve always worried that sometime something like this could \\nhappen.\" \\n\\nAlaska Gov. Steve Cowper arrived in Valdez on Friday to evaluate the spill. He \\nsaid that state officials were considering the use of chemicals to disperse and \\nsink the oil. \\n\\n\"The problem is that chemical use can have a bad effect on marine life,\" he \\nsaid. \"It\\'s going to be a tough judgment call.\" \\n\\nCowper said that conventional responses, such as booms, probably would not work \\nbecause the spill is so large. \"You probably couldn\\'t do it (contain the spill) \\nwith all the equipment available in North America. This is a major spill by any \\nreckoning. \\n\\n\"We\\'ve been able to brag for a long time that there\\'s never been a major oil \\nspill in Valdez Harbor. Now, we can\\'t do that anymore.\" \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe assassination in late September 1994 of Mr. Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in Mexico\\'s ruling party, probably removed doubts about the difficulty of reforming the Country\\'s political and judicial systems. Mr. Ruiz Massieu\\'s killing was allegedly ordered by a federal deputy of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and a former tourism developer with strong links to a Gulf drug cartel. This alleged alliance has underlined concerns that efforts by Mexico\\'s next president, Ernesto Zedillo, to reform the governing party will be met with fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from these changes.\\nIntroduction:\\nIf Mr Ernesto Zedillo, Mexico\\'s next president, had any doubts about the\\ndifficulties of reforming Mexico\\'s governing party and the country\\'s corrupt\\njudicial and legal system, the assassination last week of Mr Jose Francisco\\nRuiz Massieu, the party\\'s number two official, will probably have removed\\nthem.\\nMr Ruiz Massieu\\'s killing was allegedly ordered by Mr Manuel Munoz Rocha, a\\nfederal deputy of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI), and Mr\\nAbraham Rubio Canales, a former tourism developer with strong links to the\\nGulf drug cartel in the state of Tamaulipas.\\nThe two allegedly hired the gunman, and other accomplices, according to\\ntestimony from one man who has confessed to his role in the killing.\\nThis alleged alliance between a hardliner in the governing party and a man\\nwith links to a drug gang has underlined concerns that efforts by Mr Zedillo\\nto reform his party and the country\\'s criminal justice system will be met\\nwith fierce and violent resistance from those who stand to lose from these\\nchanges.\\nAccording to testimony from the alleged accomplices to the assassination,\\nthe conspirators drew up a list of reform-minded politicians with plans to\\nkill all of them.\\nSince Mr Ruiz Massieu\\'s assassination, there has been renewed speculation\\nthat political reactionaries and drug traffickers may have had a hand in the\\nkilling six months ago of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party\\'s\\nreform-minded presidential candidate, even though no evidence has emerged to\\nindicate this is the case.\\nMr Carlos Fuentes, the novelist, asked yesterday in a newspaper article\\nentitled \\'Who is next?\\' whether Mexico, like Colombia, was facing a period\\nof sustained political violence orchestrated by drug barons. Other\\ncolumnists have insinuated that more groups than currently revealed might be\\ninvolved in Mr Ruiz Massieu\\'s murder.\\nMr Munoz Rocha has promised to hand himself in if his safety is guaranteed,\\naccording to a statement by Mexico\\'s Congress. Two newspapers reported\\nyesterday that Mr Munoz Rocha has admitted to a role in the crime but put\\nthe responsibility on Mr Rubio Canales, who reportedly blames Mr Ruiz\\nMassieu for his conviction for fraud in 1992, and the prison sentence he is\\ncurrently serving.\\nMr Munoz Rocha said he participated in the assassination \\'because I was\\nangry that I had not been supported in my political aspirations\\'.\\nThe ruling party has denied that the crime reflects an internal battle\\nbetween ideological factions in the PRI. Mr Ignacio Pichardo, the president\\nof the party, declared on Monday that Mr Munoz Rocha \\'never had intellectual\\ninterests, never raised issues of political theory, and was never associated\\nwith making ideological pronouncements.\\'\\nMr Pichardo insisted that the reform of the PRI would go ahead. As if to\\nunderline this pledge, Ms Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the head of the PRI\\ngroup in the Chamber of Deputies and a reformist, was appointed to replace\\nMr Ruiz Massieu as the party\\'s secretary-general.\\nGovernment officials have suggested the Gulf drug cartel may have\\ndeliberately involved Mr Munoz Rocha in the assassination to maximise the\\npolitical impact of the crime.\\nThe motives of drug traffickers are uncertain. One view is they believed the\\nassassination would weaken Mr Ruiz Massieu\\'s brother, Mario, who is the\\ndeputy attorney general in charge of drug enforcement.\\nIf this was the motivation, the plan may have backfired. Mr Ruiz Massieu has\\ntaken charge of the investigation into his brother\\'s death, and search for\\ndrug cartel members appears to have intensified.\\nAnother view is the cartel was seeking revenge. Mr Mario Ruiz Massieu\\nrecently had arrested Raul Valladares, top lieutenant in the Gulf Cartel and\\nson-in-law of Mr Rubio Canales, the man in the Acapulco jail accused of\\njointly plotting the assassination.\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nFundamental welfare reform is needed within the 24 member nations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation if these states are to protect their most vulnerable citizens without endangering their economies. Welfare costs, principally for pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits and family support are rapidly becoming insupportable. The costliest item is pensions, which continue to grow due to increased coverage, benefit levels and an aging population. By the year 2040, people over age 65 will rise from their current 19% of total population to 37%. In a competitive global economy, no country can burden its businesses with higher welfare costs than its neighbors.\\nIntroduction:\\nThe welfare state, the glue that binds the social fabric of the world\\'s\\nadvanced capitalist economies, is coming unstuck. The immediate cause is its\\nincreasing cost at a time when budget deficits burden most of the 24 member\\nstates of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\\nRising welfare spending has been a significant factor in the average\\nincrease in net state borrowing of 3 percentage points of GDP across the\\nOECD between 1989 and 1992.\\nIn the longer term, there are fears that the cost of the welfare state could\\nbecome insupportable as populations age over the next 50 years.\\nWhile short-term measures may ease the immediate budgetary pressures, more\\nfundamental reforms will be needed if the welfare state is not to undermine\\nthe economic performance that has underpinned its enormous expansion since\\nthe second world war.\\nReform of national welfare systems to bring costs under control is now on\\nthe political agenda throughout the OECD, as countries struggle to rein in\\ngovernment spending. Total government spending in the OECD countries has\\nrisen from 28.1 per cent of GDP in 1960 to 43.8 per cent in 1990. The\\nbiggest element in this growth has been the cost of pensions, healthcare,\\nunemployment benefits and family support. Social security payments more than\\ndoubled during this period, from 7 per cent of GDP to 15.4 per cent. Health\\nexpenditure also doubled, from 3.9 per cent to 7.8 per cent.\\nThe largest single budget item in most welfare states is the cost of\\npublicly provided pensions. Expenditure has risen rapidly in recent decades,\\nmore than doubling its average share of GDP in OECD countries since 1960.\\nPensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public\\nexpenditure over this period.\\nThe growth is largely attributable to three factors:\\nThe increase in coverage as pension schemes introduced after the second\\nworld war mature.\\nThe rise in the number of elderly people.\\nImprovements in pension benefits, such as automatic increases to match\\nrising earnings.\\nThe maturing of the welfare state is also a significant factor in the\\ndoubling of health expenditure since 1960. Countries such as Spain, Ireland\\nand the Netherlands have been extending their public healthcare systems to\\nprovide universal coverage.\\nAs with pensions, health systems have become more generous in the wake of\\neconomic growth - for example, including grafts and transplants that were\\npreviously regarded as experimental. The ageing of the population has also\\ncontributed to rising costs, though not as much as for pensions.\\nRising unemployment has added to the cost of the welfare state in both\\nunemployment benefits and general family support for low-income families.\\nBut it has also helped to push up the budget for sickness and invalidity\\nbenefits, which often offer an escape route into early retirement for older\\nworkers.\\nMost OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main\\nareas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to\\ntackle the underlying causes. For example, governments have become much less\\nwilling to offer improvements in pensions. Moves are afoot in countries such\\nas Germany and Italy to raise the pension age. Automatic indexation of\\npensions to earnings has been weakened in Germany and ended altogether in\\nthe UK for the basic flat-rate pension.\\nHealthcare systems have been reformed to make them more efficient and to\\nbear down on the cost of pharmaceuticals. Although there are considerable\\ndifferences between national health systems, healthcare reforms in countries\\nsuch as the UK and the Netherlands are increasingly converging on models\\nthat use competition and price incentives to control costs.\\nMany countries have also begun to tighten up on unemployment benefits, with\\nreductions in benefit levels and more rigorous conditions to qualify. Active\\nlabour market policies have been introduced to promote a return to\\nemployment.\\nSome countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures\\nsuch as these. But what most concerns those responsible for public finances\\nis the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push\\ncosts upwards in the future.\\nThe most important of these is demography. Increases in life expectancy have\\nalready increased the number of elderly people collecting pensions. The\\nnumber of over-65s in the 24 OECD member states rose from 61m in 1960 to\\nmore than 100m in 1990.\\nThe growth is accelerating, with the number projected to rise to more than\\n115m in 2000, 131m in 2010 and 156m by 2020. Only halfway through the 21st\\ncentury will the number of over-65s peak, at about 190m.\\nThe strain that this will put on the welfare state can best be seen by\\nrelating it to expected trends in the number of people of working age. The\\nstandard measure for this is the age dependency ratio, the population over\\n65 as a percentage of the population aged 15-64. For the OECD as a whole,\\nthe age dependency ratio is predicted to rise from about 19 per cent in 1990\\nto 28 per cent by 2020 and 37 per cent by 2040.\\nSome countries face much greater pressures from the ageing of their\\npopulations than others. Germany and Japan, for example, will both have age\\ndependency ratios of 34 per cent by 2020 - one person over the age of 65 for\\nevery three people between 15 and 64. By 2040, almost half of Germany\\'s\\npopulation could be over 65, though the proportion will fall thereafter.\\nAge dependency ratios will climb more slowly in the UK and US, to about 25\\nper cent in 2020 - four people of working age to support every elderly\\nperson. In both countries, ratios will peak at about 33 per cent in 2040.\\nThe most immediate impact of these demographic changes will be on pensions,\\nwhere costs will in any case rise as pension schemes continue to mature.\\nOverall, the OECD estimates that the pension burden could double over the\\nnext 50 years. Real economic growth rates of up to 1.5 per cent a year would\\nbe needed to pay for pensions alone - and that on the assumption that the\\npensions do not increase in real terms.\\nIn practice, increasing pensions in line with prices might be difficult to\\nsustain if earnings rose faster. The growing gap between pensioners and\\nthose still at work that would result could be politically unacceptable.\\nHowever, raising pensions by more than prices would either require much\\nhigher growth rates or higher taxes for those in work to pay the bill.\\nThe impact of an ageing population on healthcare costs is less clear-cut.\\nExperts differ on whether increased longevity inevitably means more medical\\ncare: while more might be required for the very elderly, less might be\\nneeded for younger people as chronic diseases become less common.\\nAdditional costs of new drugs and advances in medical technology could be at\\nleast as important as demography in pushing up healthcare bills.\\nHowever, there will be an increase in demand for geriatric care and social\\nservices for the elderly. This will be encouraged by social changes, such as\\nthe decline of the extended family in which older people were cared for by\\nyounger relatives.\\nOther changes in social structure are also pushing up the demands on the\\nwelfare state. Throughout the OECD, for example, the number of lone-parent\\nfamilies has been rising since the 1960s. In some countries, the increase\\nhas been relatively moderate - 20 per cent or less in countries such as\\nFrance, Japan and Switzerland. At the other extreme, the increase has\\nexceeded 50 per cent in the UK and Australia. In the US the number has more\\nthan doubled. Lone-parent families now typically constitute 10-15 per cent\\nof of all families with children in OECD countries. In the US it is one in\\nfour families.\\nThe reasons for the growth include the greater ease of separation and\\ndivorce. But inevitably lone-parent families rely on welfare provision to a\\nfar greater extent than two-parent families.\\nAdded to concerns over demography and social change are fears over the\\nincrease in unemployment levels across the OECD. Over the past two decades,\\njobless levels have risen during recessions but not fallen back to the same\\nextent in the following recovery period.\\nThis ratchet effect has worried the Group of Seven leading industrial\\ncountries sufficiently for an employment summit to be hosted by President\\nClinton in the coming months. Continuing rises in the base level of\\nunemployment would further undermine countries\\' ability to pay for their\\nwelfare states.\\nResponses to these cost pressures vary from country to country. Germany, the\\nUK, France, Italy and the US are among countries that have already raised\\ntax and social security contribution levels.\\nHowever, the scope for such increases is limited by voters\\' reluctance to\\npay higher taxes. Where the cost of welfare is jointly funded by employers -\\nas in Germany - higher contributions are also increasingly resisted by\\nbusiness, which fears the consequences for international competitiveness of\\nhigher costs. In a global economy, no country can long afford to burden\\nbusiness with higher welfare costs than its neighbours.\\nAn alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in\\nborrowing to fund the welfare state. But that would also have deleterious\\neffects, according to the OECD. Average government debt in OECD countries\\nhas risen from 23 per cent of GDP in 1979 to 44 per cent in 1992.\\nWithout either tax rises or cuts in welfare budgets, current welfare\\nspending plans could increase debt ratios on average by 90 percentage points\\nover the next 40 years, according to one OECD study. It says this is \\'a\\nsituation which most would think unsustainable\\'.\\nThis is why the OECD\\'s half-yearly Economic Outlook repeatedly stresses the\\nimportance of controlling welfare spending in improving economic\\nperformance. The OECD\\'s immediate priorities for reform include charges for\\nthe use of some welfare services and greater competition to increase the\\nefficiency of those services.\\nBut the OECD has also drawn attention to the need for action to anticipate\\nthe funding implications of the rise in the number of elderly people.\\nTackling these longer-term pressures will require more than tinkering with\\ncharges and efficiency drives in welfare services.\\nSignificant cuts in benefit levels, for example, may be needed - including\\ngreater targeting of benefits on the most needy. User charges could become\\nincreasingly widespread, especially for the better-off. They could rise to\\ncover a much larger part of the costs of welfare services. And the demands\\nput on the welfare state might be eased by encouraging more private\\nprovision of pensions and healthcare.\\nMeasures such as these would fundamentally change the nature of the welfare\\nstate, however. From providing support \\'from the cradle to the grave\\', it\\nwould become a safety net for those who could not afford to provide for\\nthemselves.\\nAs countries become wealthier, moving the boundary between the state\\'s\\nresponsibilities and those of the individual in this way may be a natural\\nstep. But it would be politically controversial.\\nYet it is increasingly clear that there is no alternative to fundamental\\nreforms if advanced economies are to protect their most vulnerable citizens\\nwithout imposing unacceptable burdens on economic performance. The welfare\\nstate may have effectively bound societies together through the ups and\\ndowns of the economic cycle for the past 40 years. But a new glue will be\\nneeded over the next 50 years if advanced economies are to pass beyond the\\nwelfare state.\\nThis is the first in a series of articles analysing the pressures on the\\nwelfare state across the world, and examining policy options for relieving\\nthe strain\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nThe Exxon Valdez was illegally piloted by its third mate, who didn\\'t have a proper pilot\\'s license, when the vessel ran aground.

He was confident, bragging, and promising big things to come. If he returns to the sport as a winner, all is forgiven said the assistant meet director for the Hamilton Games. Johnson expressed little doubt that he could retain his 1988 form. Johnson has passed four drug tests since his suspension and has a new coach. The Canadian Olympic Association is expected to lift his ban. Johnson will command high appearance fees ($60,000 in Stockholm) initially but later will be dependent on performance.\\nIntroduction:\\nIt was a scene that recalled the golden days for Ben Johnson. Almost. The media \\nwere there, as before, chronicling a news conference. Johnson was as before, \\nshy and yet brimming with confidence. There was the bluster, the bragging, the \\npromise of big things to come. \\n\\nThis scene, which played out two weeks ago in Italy, was familiar, with one \\nexception. The new element was the pervasive skepticism that now attends \\nJohnson\\'s boasts. Overweening confidence among world class athletes is well \\naccepted -- even expected. However, part of the expectation includes the \\nunderstanding that the athlete can back up the boasts. \\n\\nJohnson will at last get his chance to do that. It has been two years since \\nJohnson, then world record-holder at 100 meters, was stripped of his gold medal \\nafter testing positive for anabolic steroids at the Seoul Olympics. Johnson was \\nalso suspended from competition for two years; that suspension ends today. And \\nso the questions begin: What can Johnson do when not assisted by \\nperformance-enhancing drugs? \\n\\n\"Once he returns to the sport, and if he returns a winner, all is forgiven,\" \\nsaid Paul Gaines, assistant meet director for the Hamilton Spectator Indoor \\nGames, the Canadian meet to be held Jan. 11 that will mark Johnson\\'s return to \\ncompetition. \"I think that is the attitude the public will display. You hear \\ngrumblings among media types and in some circles of the sport, but you have to \\ngive the guy the benefit of the doubt. \\n\\n\"When this happened, it was a bitter disappointment for everyone in the sport \\nto acknowledge that the No. 1 athlete in the sport was using drugs. With the \\naccolades cast upon him in the previous years, people were resentful. With the \\nhumility and shame that has been reflected on him, people tend to be more open \\nminded about it. They hope the guy comes back clean and fast.\" \\n\\nClean and fast. To some in track and field that represents a contradiction in \\nterms. It is this apparent contradiction that Ben Johnson must overcome in his \\ncomeback. Charlie Francis, who coached Johnson for 12 years, estimated that \\nsteroids made Johnson faster by one meter. How much ground will Johnson lose as \\na drug-free sprinter? \\n\\nJohnson, speaking at a news conference in Castelfranco Veneto, Italy, expressed \\nlittle doubt he can regain his form of 1988. \\n\\n\"I want to take back the titles and the records I have been deprived of,\" the \\nAssociated Press quoted Johnson as saying. \"I have been training very hard \\nrecently. I am at 90% right now. By strengthening training, I will be 100% by \\nJanuary. I have decided to start again to show everybody I\\'m still the best. \\nI\\'m convinced I can set a new world record.\" \\n\\n\\nBIG MONEY \\n\\nPromoters of indoor meets this season doubt that Johnson will regain his \\nrecords, but they hope that fans will turn out in huge numbers to watch him \\ntry. Indeed, in a season that holds the promise of high performance levels in \\ngeneral (as athletes peak for the world indoor championships in Seville, Spain, \\nin March), Johnson\\'s return to competition might help rejuvenate a sport in \\nneed of public interest. \\n\\nAl Franken, promoter of the Sunkist Invitational, is close to signing Johnson \\nfor his Jan. 18 meet, saying Johnson will receive the highest appearance fee \\nFranken has ever paid -- $30,000, compared to the $23,000 Franken paid Carl \\nLewis. And there is a bonus in the contract that rewards Johnson for high \\nattendance figures. \\n\\n\"I think honestly, you have to figure that a lot of it is curiosity,\" Franken \\nsaid. \"You\\'ll get people who don\\'t care about track, and you may attract back \\npeople who have quit coming to track. We need a push in the sport. It\\'s been \\nstruggling. We need a hype. Someone who is a ticket seller. Ben sort of \\ntranscends the sport, and, God knows, we need someone to transcend the sport.\" \\n\\nTranscendent is the word for the appearence fees Johnson will reportedly earn. \\nHis value in Europe and Japan has not waned. He will be paid $60,000 for a meet \\nin Stockholm. But American meet directors say they can\\'t pay that kind of \\nmoney, especially for an unproven runner. \\n\\n\"If he\\'s eligible to compete, to me, Ben Johnson is an attraction,\" said Ray \\nLumpp, meet director for the indoor meet at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, \\nN.J.. \"I\\'d like to have Ben Johnson regardless of how he runs. But how well \\nhe\\'s running will determine his value. That\\'s the key. Whether he is worth as \\nmuch after six meets, I don\\'t know. You\\'re only as good as your last race, and \\nthe fans know that.\" \\n\\nHoward Schmertz of the Millrose Games in New York has an interest in Johnson, \\nbut perhaps not the budget. \\n\\n\"There is a lot of interest in seeing whether this fellow is a truly great \\nrunner or if he is what Carl Lewis said he is, a fair runner who got there by \\ntaking drugs,\" Schmertz said. \\n\\n\"I have no way of knowing. As far as the money, I expect a lot of big stars and \\nI\\'m going to have a lot of problems giving out (big appearence fees). If you \\ngive him $10,000 and people are beating him, you could have problems.\" \\n\\nAlready the backlash has begun. There is talk of informal athlete boycotts in \\nCanada, where indoor meets often provide car fare and little else to star \\nathletes. Johnson reportedly will be paid $10,000 (Canadian) for the meet in \\nHamilton, a figure that has caused some jealousy among his peers. \\n\\nLumpp, who traditionally has one of the largest budgets in North America, said \\nresentment is a problem faced every season by meet directors. \"How many heavy \\nhitters can a meet afford?\" he said. \"There are very few secrets among \\nathletes, especially when there\\'s X dollars given to one athlete.\" \\n\\nHamilton promoter Gaines has heard it before, and makes no apology for paying \\nJohnson more than other athletes. \"My answer to that is \\'Who puts (fans) in the \\nseats? Right now, I can\\'t think of anybody who would arouse as much interest as \\nBen Johnson.\" \\n\\nIt would be ironic if Johnson becomes the star who revitalizes indoor track and \\nfield after being blamed for the steady decline of sponsor interest in outdoor \\ntrack. \\n\\n\"There has been damage to the sport and people want to blame Ben personally for \\nthat damage,\" Gaines said. \"We are very cognizant of the fact that people are \\nlooking upon his return with something like skepticism and animosity. To what \\nextent, we don\\'t know.\" \\n\\nSome meet directors report concern that longtime sponsors will be reluctant to \\nbe associated with a meet that has Johnson as its marquee athlete, given \\nJohnson\\'s former association with anabolic steroids. Franken said he had \\nmeetings with his sponsor, Sunkist, to discuss the possible image problem. \\n\\nSchmertz, too, has given the matter some thought. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve had that thought myself, paying him that much money,\" he said. \"He was \\nthe greatest sprinter in history, then he was caught. Now he\\'s got a lot of \\nnotoriety. He probably thinks he can be paid more because of the notoriety. \\nIt\\'s a very complicated issue. I don\\'t know how the public is going to react. \\nAre they going to treat him as someone who has paid his penalty and now he\\'s \\nclean? I don\\'t know. These questions have gone through my mind.\" \\n\\nWill Kern, meet director for the Times Indoor Games, hesitates at considering \\nit a moral issue. \"It\\'s kind of perplexing, isn\\'t it?,\" Kern said. \"I\\'m not \\nGod. I can\\'t say that it\\'s wrong, especially when deep down I know Johnson\\'s \\nnot the only one who\\'s ever taken drugs.\" \\n\\nOne thing that may not happen is a much-discussed lucrative match race between \\nJohnson and Lewis. \\n\\n\"I will never allow it to happen,\" Primo Nebiolo, president of the \\nInternational Amateur Atheltic Federation, said Sunday. \"We do not allow \\ntwo-horse races.\" \\n\\n\\nA NEW CAST \\n\\nJohnson, 28, has passed at least four drug tests during his suspension. He has \\nbeen an outspoken opponent of drug use and has spent the last year speaking to \\nchildren, warning them against performance-enhancing drugs. \\n\\nMany of those around Johnson have changed, too. Francis is no longer his coach, \\nhaving been replaced by Loren Seagrave, former women\\'s coach at Louisiana State \\nUniversity. Others in Johnson\\'s inner circle are Larry Heidebrecht, his agent; \\nKameel Azan, a Jamaican-born Toronto businessman and former hairdresser who is \\nJohnson\\'s adviser; and Ed Futerman, Johnson\\'s attorney. \\n\\nThe key words in the Johnson camp are Damage Control, or more simply, control. \\nFuterman limits Johnson\\'s contact with the media, saying \"Ben has said all he \\nhas to say. We don\\'t need any more media.\" However, it was Futerman who offered \\nto permit a British journalist to interview Johnson -- if he paid $10,000 and \\nsubmitted his questions in advance. Johnson gave an in-depth interview to the \\nGerman magazine, Sport, but only after being paid. \\n\\nOther than that, he has had a low profile. He still is awaiting word from the \\nCanadian Olympic Assn., which placed a lifetime ban on Johnson that prohibited \\nhim from representing Canada in the Olympic Games. The COA will meet on Friday \\nand is expected to lift the ban. \\n\\nThat may go a long way to easing Johnson back into a sport that disowned him \\nalmost as swiftly as he burst on the scene. \\n\\nWhat happened to Johnson after his positive test in Seoul is similar to what \\nused to happen to famous East Europeans after defection. Any trace of them in \\ntheir former countries disappeared. They no longer existed. Similarly, Johnson \\nwas erased from track and field\\'s record books. Not only did he have to give \\nback the gold medal, but he lost two world records, causing the sport to change \\nits rules in order to take them. \\n\\nThe IAAF voted last September to adopt the controversial \"Ben Johnson Rule\" \\nallowing the IAAF Council to decertify an athlete\\'s records, titles and results \\nif he or she later is shown to have used a banned substance before those \\nperformances. \\n\\nThe action gave the IAAF power to erase all of Johnson\\'s results between June \\n12, 1983, and June 12, 1989. Even though Johnson admitted to having taken drugs \\nsince 1981, the rule carries a six-year statue of limitations. The rule \\nstripped Johnson of his world record of 9.83 in the 100 meters and 6.41 in the \\nindoor 60 meters.

Just \\nbefore the voice vote, the senators voted, 50 to 41, against killing the \\nproposal to bar aliens from the count. \\n\\nA Senate-House conference committee will decide whether the prohibition against \\nincluding illegal immigrants in the census totals will be retained or dropped \\nfrom a $17.4-billion appropriations bill for the State, Justice and Commerce \\ndepartments. \\n\\nEven if the prohibition survives, Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher has \\nsaid that he would ask President Bush to veto any bill that comes to his desk \\nwith such a provision. \\n\\nAt stake are the number of seats in Congress for California, Florida, New York, \\nIllinois, Pennsylvania and other states that will be reapportioned on the basis \\nof next year\\'s census. \\n\\nFederal aid to states also is frequently based on population counts, so \\nmillions of dollars in grants and other funds made available on a per capita \\nbasis would be affected. \\n\\nThe issue cuts across partisan lines in the Senate, with Minority Leader Bob \\nDole (R-Kan.) arguing against the White House position on grounds that \\nincluding illegal aliens in the census is unfair to American citizens. \\n\\n\\nLoss of Seats Cited \\n\\n\"Some states will lose congressional seats because of illegal aliens,\" Dole \\nargued. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said that Georgia and Indiana both lost \\nHouse seats after the 1980 Census, and California and New York -- centers of \\nillegal immigration -- each gained seats. \\n\\n\"The bottom line is illegal aliens ought to be deported, not counted,\" Cochran \\nsaid. \\n\\nSen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) countered that excluding illegal residents from the \\ndecennial census is unfair to the states that have suffered from a huge influx \\nof immigration beyond the legal limits. \\n\\n\"There are enormous additional costs for states who have had a surge of \\npopulation,\" Wilson said, adding that those states should receive additional \\nfederal aid to cope with the added problems. \\n\\nOpponents of a ban on counting illegal aliens said that a ban is impractical \\nbecause the Census Bureau already has printed questionnaires that do not \\ncontain any question about legality of residence. \\n\\nFor 190 years, said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), the federal \\ngovernment has counted all inhabitants without regard to citizenship in \\naccordance with the Constitution\\'s provisions. \"Fiddling with the numbers\" now \\nwill destroy confidence in the census results, he added. \\n\\nThe Senate\\'s action was sharply criticized by Undersecretary of Commerce \\nMichael Darby, but he voiced hope that it would be reversed by a Senate-House \\nconference. \\n\\n\"There really is a widespread realization that this would not only be \\nunconstitutional but literally impossible,\" Darby said. \\n\\nBut he added that he is \"optimistic, cautiously optimistic,\" that House \\nconferees would resist the Senate-approved ban and not force Bush to veto the \\nlegislation. \\n\\nMario Moreno, head of the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, said he was \\nshocked by the Senate\\'s decision. \"It is going to have a dramatic and \\ndisastrous impact in the Hispanic community,\" Moreno said. \"People are going to \\nbe discouraged from participating.\" \\n\\nA Census Bureau spokesman took a more dispassionate view, however. \\n\\n\"Our position is that we count everybody at their place of residence,\" said \\nbureau spokesman James Gorman. \"If Congress passes a law that says we will or \\nwill not count people, we will do what it says.\" \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nFollowing a 1990 embargo by Serbia, Slovenian exports to the former Yugoslavia fell by 85%. Slovene officials say for capital inflows to increase Slovenia must re-establish those trade links, which accounted for 30% of Slovene exports. Slovenia is too small to attract large amounts of foreign investment to foster growth. It recently signed trade agreements with Croatia and Macedonia and is seeking new markets among EC countries. Slovenian industrial production sharply dropped and unemployment rose to 11%, but inflation fell to 5% thanks to the Slovene central bank\\'s strong monetary policy. Enterprises will need to become more competitive after privatization, now being discussed by Parliament.\\nIntroduction:\\nTHE war in the former republics of Yugoslavia is forcing Slovene enterprises\\nto find alternative trading partners among European Community countries as a\\nmeans of compensating for lost markets in the region.\\nHowever, Slovene officials warn that capital inflows will not increase\\nunless Slovenia re-establishes trade links with its southern neighbours.\\nUntil 1990, over 30 per cent of Slovenia\\'s exports were with the former\\nYugoslavia, while about 70 per cent were divided between Comecon, the now\\ndefunct socialist trading block, and western European countries. But\\nfollowing an embargo by Serbia on Slovene imports in 1990, and ensuing war\\nin neighbouring Croatia last year, Slovene exports to the former Yugoslavia\\nhave fallen to 15 per cent of that previously.\\nThe loss of markets in the former Yugoslavia, and the war, has led to a\\nsharp drop in industrial production, which last year fell by 15 per cent,\\nand will fall a further 12 per cent this year.\\nUnemployment has risen to 101,000, up from 9 per cent to 11 per cent of the\\nlabour force. However, inflation is falling thanks to a strong monetary\\npolicy implemented by Slovenia\\'s central bank. Inflation was running at 25\\nper cent a month last October, but by April it had fallen to 5 per cent.\\nMr Feri Horvath, head of Slovenia\\'s Chamber of Commerce, said Slovenia,\\nwhich declared its independence last June, must seek new markets because the\\nrepublic is too small to be able to attract large amounts of foreign\\ninvestment to foster growth.\\nRenault, French car manufacturer, which assembles cars in Slovenia, and\\nSiemens, German-based mechanical and electrical goods maker, which has a\\njoint venture with Iskra, Slovenia\\'s electronic and telecommunications\\nmanufacturer, have used Slovenia as a base for exporting to other parts of\\nYugoslavia, as well as to western Europe.\\n\\'We have recently signed bilateral trade agreements with Croatia and\\nMacedonia,\\' said Mr Horvath. \\'We want to normalise relations with the other\\nrepublics,\\' he added.\\nIn the meantime, Slovene enterprises, particularly those in the furniture,\\nelectronics, paper, and white goods sector, are exporting to European\\nCommunity countries.\\nExports for the first quarter amounted to Dollars 941m (Pounds 513m), and\\nimports totalled Dollars 752m.

Programs to date have not solved this problem. The U.S. Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and invest directly in the private sector. Other bank managers want to see political strings attached to the World Bank\\'s loans. The World Bank\\'s goals of democracy and free markets are alien to some Third World countries. The bank\\'s own research department believes that poverty must be relieved directly and thence education and health care improved.\\nIntroduction:\\nHow can 6,000 civil servants, mostly based in Washington, best promote\\ndevelopment in the Third World? That is the vexing question facing Mr Lewis\\nPreston, the former chairman of J P Morgan, the New York bank, who takes\\nover as president of the World Bank this September.\\nAs bankers and finance ministers gathered in Washington this weekend for the\\nspring meetings of the bank and International Monetary Fund, there was no\\nshortage of advice. The US Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments\\nof developing countries and lend sizeable sums directly to the private\\nsector. The bank is also under pressure to follow the example of Mr Jacques\\nAttali\\'s European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and attach\\nstrict political conditions to its loans. Development economists, meanwhile,\\nare urging the bank to respect the rhetoric of last year\\'s World Development\\nReport and focus more on poverty alleviation.\\nMr Preston may relax on one count. Few in Washington now doubt that the bank\\nis needed: new imperatives, such as reconstruction in eastern Europe and the\\nMiddle East, have merely been superimposed on older, unsolved problems:\\nGrinding poverty is a near universal condition in much of the world: 1bn\\npeople live on less than Dollars 1 a day.\\nMore than 110m Third World children lack access even to primary education.\\nHorrific inequality abounds. In Mexico, life expectancy for the poorest 10\\nper cent is 20 years less than for the richest 10 per cent.\\nWhat kind of bank will Mr Preston inherit from his predecessor, Mr Barber\\nConable? Most reports are mixed. \\'It is not an impressive bureaucracy,\\' says\\nMr John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International\\nEconomics. \\'The morale of staff is lousy,\\' says Mr Charles Flickner, a\\nsenior analyst on the Senate Budget Committee and close observer of the\\nbank. Mr Conable, a former Republican congressman, arrived at the bank in\\n1986 knowing little about either banking or development. Although now\\nwell-liked (partly for championing causes such as women\\'s rights in the\\nThird World), many observers say he never fully recovered from a rocky start\\ninvolving a divisive internal reorganisation of the bank.\\nMr Percy Mistry, a scholar at Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford, and former\\nsenior adviser at the bank, says it suffered from \\'presidential failure\\'\\nduring the 1980s. Mr Robert McNamara, a forceful chief executive in the\\n1970s, built a presidential institution that responded to firm leadership\\nfrom the top. But neither Mr Conable nor his predecessor, Mr A W \\'Tom\\'\\nClausen, a commercial banker, could fill his shoes. For a decade the bank\\nhas effectively been run by two senior - and strong-willed -\\nvice-presidents: Mr Ernest Stern (who nearly left last year to join the\\nEBRD) and Mr Moeen Qureshi.\\nMr Preston\\'s first challenge, says Mr Mistry, will be to wrest control of\\nthe bank from Messrs Stern and Qureshi; his second, to prune legions of\\n\\'useless advisers\\' and install managers with real-world experience. His\\nthird, one might add, will be quickly to establish his independence from the\\nUS Treasury which always browbeats a newcomer.\\nWhat kind of development legacy will Mr Preston inherit? In spite of recent\\nprogress in a few countries, such as Mexico, the past decade has been one of\\nrelative failure. Many Third World countries have gone backwards. Real per\\ncapita incomes have declined substantially in sub-Saharan Africa and the\\nMiddle East, and mildly in Latin America.\\nThe biggest drag on growth is the huge debt accumulated in the 1970s and\\nearly 1980s. Many optimists see the debt reduction strategy launched by Mr\\nNicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, in 1989, as a \\'final solution\\' to\\nthe debt crisis. Under the plan official agencies assume some of the burden\\nof developing countries\\' private debts on condition that they implement\\nmarket-oriented economic reforms.\\n\\'The Brady plan is enough,\\' says Mr Williamson, if developing countries are\\nwilling to embrace reform and if it is matched by greater forgiveness of\\nofficial debt. Officials such as Mr David Mulford of the US Treasury say the\\nrecent forgiveness of about half of Poland\\'s official debt will not set a\\nprecedent for other debtors. Mr Williamson laughs. \\'In the long run it will\\nbe impossible to isolate Poland,\\' he says. \\'It is not so much more deserving\\nthan other countries.\\'\\nBut why was a Brady-type solution not launched much earlier? For most of the\\n1980s, the First World doggedly refused to consider debt forgiveness. The\\nresult of delay and compound interest is a total debt burden today of some\\nDollars 1,341bn compared with a relatively manageable Dollars 639bn in 1980.\\n\\'The bank failed to take a timely leadership position on the debt crisis,\\'\\nconcludes Mr Richard Feinberg, director of the Overseas Development Council\\nin Washington. (The IMF was equally short-sighted.)\\nAs incoming president, Mr Preston must review the bank\\'s strategies for\\npromoting development. The main innovation of the 1980s was a switch from\\nproject lending to \\'structural adjustment\\' lending. Making finance\\nconditional on structural reforms was supposed to transform the economic\\nperformance of developing countries.\\nBut studies indicate the results have been fairly unimpressive. This is both\\nbecause countries failed to abide by the loan conditions and because the\\nbank\\'s policies were sometimes misguided. Professor John Toye, director of\\nthe Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, recently\\ncompleted an exhaustive analysis of bank programmes. He concludes (as do\\ninternal bank analyses) that policy-based lending has \\'achieved something,\\nparticularly in relation to the external account, but not nearly as much as\\nthe bank and donor community hoped\\'. On average programmes have reduced\\nbalance of payments gaps, had a negligible impact on Gross National Product\\nand led to falls in the ratio of investment to GNP.\\nMr Feinberg calls the decline in investment the \\'great shortcoming of\\nstructural adjustment lending in the 1980s\\'. (Investment to GNP ratios have\\nfallen markedly in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.) He says the\\nbank was naive to expect entrepreneurs to respond to the austerity of\\nadjustment by increasing investment.\\nHow can the bank do better in the 1990s? One problem is that it has lost\\nleverage over many Third World governments. The maturing of bank programmes\\nand the failure to expand lending much in the 1980s has led to a marked\\nshrinkage in its net transfers to developing countries. According to Mr\\nLawrence Summers, the bank\\'s chief economist, net transfers over the next\\nfive years will be about Dollars 2 per person in the developing world\\ncompared with Dollars 9 (in current prices) in the late 1970s. For the large\\nnumber of countries that do not qualify for concessional loans, the net flow\\nwill be negative.\\nSome analysts, including US Treasury officials, believe lacklustre\\nperformance in much of the Third World reflects the inefficiency (and\\nsometimes corruption) of governments. The EBRD\\'s constitution requires\\nborrowers to be \\'committed to and applying the principles of multi-party\\ndemocracy, pluralism and market economics\\'. It also says 60 per cent of EBRD\\nresources must be devoted to the commercial sector - private businesses and\\nstate concerns in the process of privatisation. The World Bank operates\\nunder very different rules: its charter requires it to be non-political and\\nonly its small affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), can\\nmake direct loans to private businesses. Should the bank\\'s charter be\\namended?\\nDirect parallels between the bank and the EBRD are dubious. The EBRD is\\nministering to a region that has historical ties with western Europe and\\nthat has declared its commitment to democracy and free markets. Such values\\nare alien in many developing countries, but that does not imply they should\\nbe denied the means for economic development. If strict political\\nconditionality had been imposed in the past, the bank could not have lent to\\na development star such as South Korea.\\nMost analysts, however, say the bank should tighten up a little. Mr Flickner\\nof the Senate Budget Committee says the issue is not whether to insist on\\nWestminster-style democracy but whether the form of governance is such that\\n\\'loans will benefit the majority of the people\\'. Bank officials say greater\\nattention will be paid to issues such as the rule of law and transparency of\\ndecision-taking.\\nShould a significant chunk of the bank\\'s loans be made direct to the private\\nsector? Mr Conable, to his credit, is resisting the US Treasury\\'s pressure.\\nHe says the bank\\'s main aim is to combat poverty and that it will seek a\\n\\'balanced relationship between government and the market\\' in developing\\ncountries. In reality, much of the most badly-needed investment is in\\nspheres such as infrastructure, health care and education where governments\\nplay a dominant role even in industrialised countries.\\nIndeed, one conclusion of Prof Toye\\'s analysis is that policy-based loans\\nwould have a greater chance of success if they included measures to expand\\nthe role of the state in poorer countries alongside measures to promote\\neconomic liberalisation.\\nSir William Ryrie, the head of the IFC, says the objective of a large volume\\nof public lending to the private sector is wrong-headed. \\'What we are trying\\nto do is facilitate the flow of private-sector funds into sound\\ninvestments.\\' Advocates of a switch to direct support of the private sector\\nare surely not arguing for public subsidies for Third World entrepreneurs;\\nbut if subsidies are ruled out, why should the bank\\'s judgment of market\\nrisk be more reliable than that of private lenders in the west?\\nThere are alternative recipes for fostering faster Third World development.\\nDuring the 1980s the bank placed great faith in free market nostrums. It\\nwanted to impose on developing countries policies that had become recently\\nfashionable in the industrialised world. But the notion that economic\\nliberalisation alone is sufficient is increasingly questioned. The bank\\'s\\nown research department is highlighting the need to relieve poverty directly\\nand to improve fundamentals, such as education, nutrition and health care.\\n\\'Liberalisation matters,\\' says Mr Williamson at the Institute for\\nInternational Economics, \\'but education is more important.\\' He argues that\\nthe best way of stimulating growth and improving income distribution is to\\nput resources into education and primary health care. Mr Feinberg at the\\nOverseas Development Council broadly agrees: the bank has got to find a way\\nof \\'melding equity and efficiency as it promotes development\\'.\\nThe challenge for Mr Preston is clear: put the sterile ideological battles\\nof the 1980s behind the bank and develop policies that put greater emphasis\\non the formation of human capital.\\nMr Summers, the bank\\'s economist, says pessimistically that because\\ndevelopment money will be in short supply over the next decade, the bank and\\nother donors will have to concentrate on exporting ideas. Ideas are\\ncertainly important, but they do not build hospitals or schools. More money\\ncould be made available: a mere 10 per cent cut in western defence spending,\\nfor example, would pay for a doubling of official aid. Rather than tamely\\naccepting the status quo, Mr Preston could use his platform to promote a\\nmore constructive attitude in rich countries.\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                FALLS IN INVESTMENT\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Domestic investment as % of GNP\\n                                  1975-82         1983-90\\nAll developing countries            26.7            23.6\\nAfrica                              26.4            19.4\\nMiddle East                         26.3            23.4\\nLatin America &amp; Caribbean           23.3            18.3\\nAsia                                27.9            28.9\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSource: IMF\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n            WORLD BANK DISBURSEMENTS\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n            By region (Fiscal 1990)\\nBillion dollars          Gross           Net\\nSub-Sahara Africa         2.70           1.98\\nAsia                      6.27           3.72\\nEurope, Middle East and\\nN Africa                  2.57           0.39\\nLatin America &amp; Caribbean 6.16           3.25\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSource: World Bank\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nMultitudes of native peoples, tourists and scientists today observed a sun that was blackened for up to four minutes.

The Department said that it was instituting new cure programs, and taking measures to improve tuberculosis prevention programs. Children must be tested before entering school, and homeless centers and substance-abuse centers are getting special attention. The greatest concentration of new cases was in the 25-44 age group. The number of men in the caseload was twice that the number of women.\\nIntroduction:\\n\\nNEW YORK -- The incidence of active tuberculosis cases in\\nthe city rose 38% in 1990, to 3,520 cases, according to the\\nhealth commissioner.\\n\\nThe commissioner, Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., said that\\nalthough the increase causes concern, the city Department of\\nHealth is \"acting aggressively to halt the epidemic.\" The\\nhealth department has a high cure rate in its tuberculosis\\nclinics, with more than 70% successfully completing therapy.\\nDr. Myers said that besides special prevention and\\nintervention strategies for high-risk populations, the city\\nis providing $1.3 million for additional efforts.\\n\\nThe health department said it is providing tuberculosis\\ntesting and treatment for the Human Resources\\nAdministration\\'s program for the homeless, and will train\\nstaff members on tuberculosis prevention and control. The\\ndepartment also has an established residence for homeless\\ntuberculosis patients, and is working with substance-abuse\\ntreatment services to extend tuberculosis prevention in its\\nprograms.

A recent media report indicates that 87 percent of gun owners themselves favor a seven-day waiting period for handguns; three quarters favor registration of semi-automatic weapons and half favor registration of rifles and shotguns. The Second Amendment to the Constitution, however, continues to be the thorn in the side of any legal effort toward gun control. Pro-gun advocates accept the wording of the amendment at face value, that is, a right to bear arms. Gun control advocates attempt to put the amendment in its 1792 context in defining its meaning.\\nIntroduction:\\nAround the world, national theologies are crumbling: communism, apartheid and, \\nhere in America, the worship of guns -- to foreigners, the single craziest \\nthing about us. \\n\\nDo you sense an outbreak of sanity about gun control? I do. There was retired \\nChief Justice Warren Burger preaching sacrilege on the cover of Parade magazine \\na couple of weeks ago. A Time Magazine/Cable News Network poll reports that 87% \\nof gun owners themselves favor a seven-day waiting period for handgun \\npurchases; three-quarters favor registration of semi-automatic weapons and \\nhandguns, and half favor registration of rifles and shotguns. \\n\\nUnfortunately, there is the Second Amendment to the Constitution: \"A well \\nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right \\nof the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" \\n\\nMost right thinkers take comfort in that funny stuff about the militia. Since \\nthe amendment\\'s stated purpose is arming state militias, they reason, it \\ncreates no individual right to own a gun. That reasoning is good enough for the \\nACLU. But would civil-libertarians be so stinting about an amendment they felt \\nmore fond of? Say, the First? \\n\\nThe purpose of the First Amendment\\'s free-speech guarantee was pretty clearly \\nto protect political discourse. But liberals reject the notion that free speech \\nis therefore limited to political topics, even broadly defined. True, that \\npurpose is not inscribed in the amendment itself. But why leap to the \\nconclusion that a broadly worded constitutional freedom (\"the right of the \\npeople to keep and bear arms\") is narrowly limited by its stated purpose, \\nunless you\\'re trying to explain it away? A colleague says that if liberals \\ninterpreted the Second Amendment the way they interpret the rest of the Bill of \\nRights, there would be law professors arguing that gun ownership is mandatory. \\n\\nThe most thorough parsing of the Second Amendment is a 1983 article in the \\nMichigan Law Review by Don Kates, a gun enthusiast. Kates expends most energy \\ndemonstrating that at the time of the Bill of Rights, all able-bodied men were \\nconsidered to be part of the \"militia\" and were expected to defend the state if \\nnecessary. I\\'m not sure this is as clinching an argument as Kates seems to \\nthink. The fact that once upon a time everyone was a member of the militia \\ndoesn\\'t prove that everyone still has a right to a gun even after the \\ncomposition of the militia has changed. \\n\\nBut Kates has other bullets in his belt. The phrase \"right of the people\" \\nappears four other times in the Bill of Rights (including the First Amendment). \\nIn all these other cases, everyone agrees that it creates a right for \\nindividual citizens, not just some collective right of states as a whole. Kates \\nalso marshals impressive historical evidence that the Second Amendment, like \\nother Bill of Rights protections, was intended to incorporate English common \\nlaw rights of the time, which pretty clearly included the right to keep a gun \\nin your home for reasons having nothing to do with the militia. \\n\\nIf there is a good reply to Kates\\'s fusillade, the controllers haven\\'t made it. \\nOf course the existence of an individual right to own guns doesn\\'t mean that it \\nis absolute. What are the limits? In the Supreme Court\\'s one 20th-Century \\ntreatment of the Second Amendment, it held somewhat ambiguously in 1939 that \\nsawed-off shotguns aren\\'t necessarily protected by the Constitution without \\nproof that they are the kind of weapon a militia might have used. \\n\\nWorking from that decision and the common law, Kates says the amendment\\'s \\nprotection should be limited to weapons \"in common use among law-abiding \\npeople,\" useful for law enforcement or personal defense, and lineally descended \\nfrom weapons known to the Framers. (No nuclear bombs.) He adds that they must \\nbe light enough for an ordinary person to carry (\"bear\"), and even that they \\ncan\\'t be especially \"dangerous or unusual.\" He says that the amendment places \\nno limit on mandatory registration or laws against concealed weapons in public. \\n\\nThis list seems quite reasonable and moderate, though where it all comes from \\nis not clear. In suggesting, for example, that it would be fine to ban \\nautomatic rifles but not semi-automatics, Kates is slicing the constitutional \\nsalami pretty thin. But in what I suspect was the main purpose of his exercise \\n-- establishing that a flat ban on handguns would be hard to justify under the \\nConstitution -- Kates builds a distressingly good case. \\n\\nThe downside of having a Bill of Rights is that the protection of individual \\nrights usually entails social costs. This is as true of the Second Amendment as \\nit is of the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth. The downside of having those \\nrights inscribed in a Constitution, protected from the whims of majority rule, \\nis that they can\\'t be re-defined as life changes. It would be remarkable indeed \\nif none of the Bill of Rights became less sensible and more burdensome with \\ntime. \\n\\nTalking and writing are as central to American democracy as they ever were; \\nshooting just isn\\'t. Gun nuts are unconvincing (at least to me) in their \\nattempts to argue that the individual right to bear arms is still as vital to \\nfreedom as it was in 1792. But the right is still there. \\n\\n\\x1aAbstract:\\nJapan, one of the most earthquake-prone areas of the world, supports an early- warning center, monitored constantly to report any unusual seismic activity in the Tokai area. Elaborate plans have been made to evacuate danger areas, reroute traffic and close schools and businesses if experts feel a quake is imminent. Although most other countries have given up trying to predict quakes, Japan continues to spend 2.5 million dollars yearly to support this effort, which covers only a limited area. The source of the danger is the Suruga Trough, a deep off-shore trench which forms a boundary between two tectonic plates. It last ruptured in 1854, and evidence is that significant strain has accumulated since the last big earthquake.\\nIntroduction:\\nSome 160km west of Tokyo in Japan\\'s coastal Tokai region is what may be the\\nworld\\'s most dense array of geophysical instruments. More than 150 meters\\nand gauges track seismic activity, rock strain, crustal tilt, tidal\\nmovements and ground water levels.\\nThe data are telemetered to Tokyo where they are monitored around the clock\\nin the hope that six experts, to be summoned at a moment\\'s notice, will\\nrecognise unusual phenomena that may indicate an imminent earthquake. If the\\ncommittee so advises, Japan\\'s prime minister will issue an earthquake\\nwarning for the Tokai area.\\nTrains will be stopped, traffic routed out of the area, stores closed and\\npupils let out of schools. Areas prone to landslides and tidal waves will be\\nevacuated. Hospitals, firefighters and rescue crews will go on alert. And\\nthen everyone will wait for an earthquake measuring eight on the Richter\\nscale.\\nLong after the rest of the world has abandoned hope of predicting\\nearthquakes, Japan continues to spend Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.6m) a year\\nmonitoring the Tokai region and close to Dollars 100m more on general\\nearthquake prediction research. For prediction believers, it is a small\\nprice to pay, as Japan is one of the world\\'s most earthquake-prone\\ncountries.\\nBut for increasingly vocal sceptics in Japan, it is at best a misguided\\neffort that wastes money and is dangerously misleading the public. Despite\\nthe protests, however, Japan\\'s earthquake prediction programme rolls along\\non inertia, insularity and unrealistic public expectations.\\nJapan made earthquake prediction a national project in 1965 when scientists\\nthroughout the world were optimistic about prediction. Research was also\\nbeing taken seriously in the US, Russia and China.\\nIn Japan, prediction took on urgency when seismologists concluded that the\\nTokai area was overdue for a significant quake.\\nThe Suruga Trough, a deep submarine trench running just offshore, forms the\\nboundary between two of the earth\\'s tectonic plates. The Philippine Sea\\nPlate is diving beneath the Eurasian Plate. Friction between these plates\\ncauses the area\\'s earthquakes.\\nThe Tokai section last ruptured in 1854. If the entire section ruptures\\nagain, the resulting quake could reach eight on the Richter scale,\\nendangering the lives of 10m residents in the area. That prospect led to the\\n1978 Large-Scale Earthquake Countermeasures Act, which established the\\nwarning procedure and launched hazard mitigation and emergency response\\nprogrammes.\\nSince then, optimism about prediction has faded. Even prediction supporters\\nadmit there is no scientific theory on which to base a forecast. Prediction\\nhinges on spotting anomalous phenomena, or precursors. Unfortunately, it has\\nproved impossible to conclude consistently and definitively whether the\\nsignspredictors look for - swarms of small earthquakes, unusual bulges and\\ncreeps in the earth\\'s crust, sudden changes in geomagnetism or electrical\\nresistivity - are precursors or simply background geologic noise.\\nPrecursors are often only recognised as such after a large earthquake. And\\nmany earthquakes occur without any identifiable precursor, even in\\nretrospect.\\nThere are also questions as to whether Japan\\'s monitoring efforts are\\nfocused in the right place. Recent studies by seismologists at the Ministry\\nof Construction have indicated the possibility of a significant quake\\noccurring in the Izu area between Tokai and Tokyo. The city is overdue for a\\nbig quake, according to several theories. Japan has had numerous killer\\nquakes outside the Tokai monitoring network, including a 7.8 earthquake off\\nthe coast of Hokkaido last year that claimed more than 200 lives.\\nKiyoo Mogi, chairman of the six-member panel that will make the call on the\\nTokai earthquake and former head of the University of Tokyo\\'s Earthquake\\nResearch Institute, says several factors make the Tokai region more suited\\nthan others for what he calls \\'a national experiment\\'.\\nThe region\\'s geology is straightforward, so they can narrow down the likely\\nlocation of the anticipated earthquake. Historically, strain along the\\nSuruga Trough has been released in infrequent large earthquakes, rather than\\nnumerous small ones. The evidence is that significant strain has accumulated\\nalong the fault since the region\\'s last big earthquake.\\nRecognising precursors will still be difficult. Mogi says they now believe\\nthat precursor patterns may be particular to each section of a fault. He\\nsays if they knew what precursory phenomena occurred the last time that\\nsection of the fault slipped, in 1854, they would be able to predict the\\nnext earthquake. Instead, the six experts are watching for the rapid uplift\\nof the crust on the westward side of the trough that preceded quakes along\\nadjacent sections of the fault in 1944 and 1946. This all makes a successful\\nprediction a long shot.\\nAside from the Tokai effort, scientists outside the programme are disturbed\\nthat it is so generously funded and has so little to show.\\nPrediction research elsewhere withered as scientists who could not convince\\nreview committees of the scientific merit of their research lost their\\nfunding. Japan\\'s prediction research activities, primarily overseen by the\\nMinistry of Education, Science and Culture, are subject to no such review.\\nA sub-committee of one of the ministry\\'s innumerable advisory bodies draws\\nup five-year plans. But, in effect, the budget is divided among researchers\\nand institutions in the same proportions each year.\\nThe public, and even public officials, remain largely unaware that Japan\\'s\\nscientists are debating whether prediction is impossible or merely\\ndifficult. Most citizens do not realise that Tokai is the only region in\\nwhich the government even intends to attempt a short-term warning.\\nHigh public expectations are coming back to haunt the six-member panel of\\nexperts, which must conclude that the gathered data indicate either \\'a cause\\nfor concern\\' or \\'no cause for concern\\'. Mogi would like to add a third\\ncategory between the two that would indicate \\'some level of concern\\'.\\nMany scientists agree a \\'maybe\\' is not unreasonable, given the state of the\\nart. Public officials, however, are insisting the experts make an \\'it\\'s\\ncoming\\' or \\'it\\'s not\\' decision. Meanwhile, the controversy might be settled\\nif the experts get their call from the technicians monitoring the Tokai\\ndata.\\n\\x1a'"
