      "D: Contributed^ News: ETFGI:^ Global ETFs/ETPs^ Gather^ Assets^ During Roller^ Coaster^ Month RIA^ Firms^ that Offer Financial Planning are Surviving^ and Thriving^ Why You Should Introduce^ Your Adult^ Children to Your Financial Advisor As a grandparent,^ you probably take a certain amount of pleasure in showering^ your grandkids^ with the occasional^ extravagance.^ That takes me to a story shared by my colleague^ Michael Graci,^ an investor education and retirement specialist here at BlackRock.^ Mike’s^ sister was contemplating^ the idea of buying her nine-year-old^ granddaughter^ a pony^ for her birthday.^ Mike tallied^ the potential cost in his head (horse,^ boarding^ fees,^ veterinary^ bills,^ feed,^ saddle,^ bridles^ and, of course, riding lessons).^ Consummate^ professional (and good brother)^ that he is, Mike suggested she take that pony^ money and put it into a 529^ plan for her granddaughter’s^ education. Tax-free^ growth over the years could potentially add hundreds if not thousands of dollars to that investment. “You may not win the ‘grandmother^ of the year award’^ today,”^ he told her, “but^ in nine or 10 years …”^ Mike was onto something,^ and I wanted to continue our conversation.^ So here is the abridged^ version for my readers,^ particularly all of you grandparents^ looking to gift your grandkids^ with something that is, in so many ways, priceless—a^ college education. Rob Kron^ (RK):^ Should a grandparent^ open a separate 529^ account or contribute to one the parent has established?^ Mike Graci^ (MG):^ Most states allow you to contribute to a 529^ created by someone else, but a grandparent^ can also create an account on behalf of a grandchild.^ This makes the grandparent^ the account owner,^ with full authority over the assets—when^ and how they are used,^ and for whose benefit.^ If you opt to contribute to a 529^ created by someone else, or when assigning^ ownership of your account to a successor,^ make sure it is someone you have confidence will use those assets prudently.^ RK:^ Why aren’t more grandparents^ opening 529s?^ MG:^ 529^ plans are only about 15 years old. Many grandparents^ did not have access to them when they were planning for the education of their own children, and many still do not know these programs exist.^ That was certainly the case with my sister.^ RK:^ Will the grandparent’s^ 529^ hurt the student’s^ chance of getting financial aid?^ MG:^ Yes and no. There’s a common perception that financial aid implications may be less onerous^ when the grandparent^ is the 529^ account owner.^ While it’s true that assets owned by a grandparent^ are not reported on a student’s^ federal financial aid application (FAFSA),^ be aware that any of those plan assets that are used to pay for college are reportable^ on the FAFSA^ the following year as student income.^ This potentially reduces the amount of future aid.^ For this reason, some students opt to use the assets held in a grandparent-owned^ 529^ in the final year of college since they will not be filing a FAFSA^ the following year. RK:^ And what about gift-tax^ consequences for the grandparents?^ MG:^ Whether grandparents^ contribute to a 529^ account they own or to a parent-owned^ account, the contribution is a gift to the account beneficiary.^ For contributions over $14,000,^ the grandparent^ may elect^ to treat up to $70,000^ of the contribution as a gift made over a five-year period. This election allows the grandparent^ to “front-load”^ contributions into the 529^ plan without exceeding^ the $14,000^ annual gift tax exclusion.^ For example, a grandparent^ could make a $70,000^ contribution to a grandchild’s^ 529^ account in 2015 and avoid the gift tax as long as the grandparent^ does not make any other gifts until 2020. And it’s possible you could contribute even more (the lifetime gift credit is currently $5.43^ million).^ We recommend discussing the possibilities with a financial advisor.^ RK:^ What if the grandparent^ needs to enter a nursing home or is seeking Medicaid^ to cover medical expenses?^ MG:^ Many grandparents^ wonder whether 529^ monies^ are counted^ among their total assets should they need nursing home care or Medicaid^ benefits. The answer is “yes”^ in most states, but it’s really no different than the treatment applied to IRA assets, for example.^ The government will ask that you use your own money to provide care for yourself before it will pay for your care. Taxes^ (and potential penalties)^ will vary by state. There are ways to manage this, however, and we always recommend speaking with a tax or legal professional.^ One final point:^ If you decide to transfer the 529^ account to someone else’s^ name or even if the assets are used by the beneficiary^ for college,^ be aware of “look-back”^ rules. This means the government can look back a certain number of years on that activity when determining Medicaid^ eligibility.^ RK:^ I hate to ask,^ but what if the grandparent^ passes away?^ MG:^ The 529^ account does not end or terminate^ upon death of the owner.^ Most,^ if not all, 529^ account applications suggest the owner name a successor^ owner upon death. So the account will continue under the new owner chosen by the grandparent.^ If a successor^ is not designated,^ a new account owner may have to be decided through probate.^ RK:^ And your sister,^ did she opt for the horse or the 529?^ MG:^ She bought the horse,^ but she tells me she is still going to open a 529.^ She’ll^ be hearing from me again. Rob Kron,^ Managing Director, is the head of Investment and Retirement^ Education for BlackRock’s^ U.S. Wealth^ Advisory group. He provides practical information on topics that are important to every saver^ and investor of every age. \n"
